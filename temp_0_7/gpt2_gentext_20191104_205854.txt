We have three rules for you that need to be followed. You can't spend too much money on a set of drums and a [insert random synthesizer here]. The only thing you should spend money on is equipment. If you want something that is going to sound good, it is basically a synthesizer. If you want to use some funky synths and you want to have a little bit of a mood, you have a synthesizer. If you want to get some weird sounds and you want to have them big, you have a synthesizer. If you want… you want to do the MC Hammer thing, you have a synth. If you want to do something that is going to be special, you have a synthesizer. If you want a big synthesizer, you have a synthesizer. You know what I mean? That kind of stuff.
Gary Bartz    
Yeah.
Todd L. Burns    
We can have a question for you. I know we have a couple of people here with drums and a synthesizer and we can have a question, but I think you said you were just looking for a sequencer. Did you want to switch to drums or do you have a specific thing that you wanted to do in drums?
Todd L. Burns    
I thought I had drums, I would have a synth. I just had a set of drums that I had.
Gary Bartz    
Yeah, yeah. I would have a little bit of a drum set. It is a pretty bad thing to have a synthesizer. It is not going to sound great. I mean, a drum kit isn’t going to sound great.
Todd L. Burns    
What do you think about the drums?
Todd L. Burns    
You know what I mean? I think that is what I was looking for, and I think that is what most people have. You want a drum kit to be a drum kit. You want a drum kit to be a synth. You want a drum kit to be a synthesizer. You want beats to be music and you want samples. You want to have a whole world around you. You want to have a whole sound. You want to have a whole world of possibilities. I don’t want to have a set of drums and a synth. I like drums. I love synths. I love drums. That is what I was looking for.
Gary Bartz    
Yeah.
Todd L. Burns    
A little bit of everything.
Todd L. Burns    
Yeah, yeah.
Todd L. Burns    
Take a little bit of everything. We have a little bit of everything.
Todd L. Burns    
Yeah. I think that’s it.
Todd L. Burns    
OK.
Todd L. Burns    
Do you have any questions?
Todd L. Burns    
Hey, I just want to say thank you for being here. I mean, there’s a lot to talk about, as far as the music industry. I have a lot of respect for everybody that is involved in it, but at the end of the day, it’s really about what you want to do, and I’m excited for what I have coming up. Thank you.
Todd L. Burns    
Yeah. I mean, I don’t want to be like you, I’m not going to be here. I’m not going to be your kind of guy. I’m going to be somebody that people look up to, but at the end of the day, it’s about the music that you are making, and you’re not going to be the kind of guy that everybody is going to be, and I think that’s the key, and that’s the important thing, is that you’re listening to the music that you are making, and you’re not going to be like me, you’re going to be somebody that people look up to. I’ll be there for you. I’m here for you.
Todd L. Burns    
I’m going to say the same thing about that.
Todd L. Burns    
That’s true, yeah.
Todd L. Burns
I understand that.
Todd L. Burns    
Good. I mean, I’ve got a lot of respect for you. You do have a lot of respect for everyone that is involved in that, and that’s great. I’m really appreciative that you are so open-minded, and I’ve got a
====================
We are all very familiar with the old school hip-hop scene, but in San Francisco there are new school hip-hop collective from Noisey and Artists, and outside of the city there are whole new school hip-hop groups like Young Money, Cypress Hill, and all kind of new students coming up and they just want to take it to the next level. 
At the moment, it’s still early, and it’s just developing. People are getting more and more into the hip-hop scene, and I think that’s exactly what we’re going to see as well. 
Anne Chesnoff
The way you described it, you said that you’re a part of the  DNA of hip-hop, which is just young people with a passion for music, and you’re already doing all kinds of music, and you’re going to have a lot of big artists coming up. And I saw this particular group, Cypress Hill, that you had on the album, and they had a lot of hits on their albums. I mean, they’re a good example of a group that people were trying to get their attention to, and they’re doing their thing, and they’re doing their thing. I think that’s a good example of what happens when there’s an artist that people are trying to get their attention to, and they’re doing their thing. 
I think that’s a good example of when a very influential group is trying to get your attention, and they’re doing their thing, and it’s just a kind of disease that we’re seeing, and we’re seeing it in a lot of hip-hop. But this is a different type of disease than when a group is trying to get your attention because they’re trying to do their thing, they’re trying to do their thing, and it’s just a different thing. 
We saw it in The Roots, which we’ve seen in the ‘80s, ‘80s, and we saw it in the ‘80s and ‘90s. But it’s just a different type of disease. People are trying to get their attention, they’re trying to do their thing, and they’re doing it. And I think that’s exactly what we’re going to see in a lot of hip-hop in the future. 
Audience member
Yeah, definitely. 
Anne Chesnoff
I think we have a lot of good questions today. We’ve got all of the questions, and we can talk about them, and we can try to answer them. Or we can talk about them, and we can talk about them, and we can talk about them. But we don’t need to spend all of our time with the same questions that we have, we don’t need to spend all of our time answering the same questions that we have. We’ve got great questions from here, and we’ll try to answer them for you. 
Audience member
Hi, thank you so much. 
Anne Chesnoff
It’s great. 
Audience member
Hi, you said you’re a part of the DNA of hip-hop. Can you tell us a little bit about the Cypress Hill hip-hop scene? 
Anne Chesnoff
Yeah, it started out in parts of San Francisco, and it started with Cypress Hill, and it’s really really a very close-knit community, and it’s really a small community. It’s a very niche community, but it’s a very big rap group. I mean, Cypress Hill is very talented. It’s very talented, but it’s very, very small, and it’s not a big rap group, but it’s more of a group, and it’s not like the Cypress Hill thing that we had, it’s a different type of thing. Cypress Hill is a different type of music, and it’s about a very close-knit group of friends, and they’re very good friends. 
They’re really good friends of mine. They always have good music, and they’re good friends of mine. 
(music: Cypress Hill – “Chi-Chi (Kissing Kisses” / applause) 
And I think that’s the main reason why Cypress Hill started, and it’s a very close-knit community. I think it was really good music, did it have a big impact on you? 
Anne Chesnoff
Well, it did.

====================
”Beware!” was so popular at the time, and “Beware!” is a classic, “stay-at-home dad” song. It was a lot of people have, and now it’s kind of a cool song to have on your album, because it’s not popular as many as it was back then. I think it’s just that, “Beware,” the word, which was ubiquitous at the time. It was quite popular at the time, but now it’s really a song that doesn’t really get played a lot, and a lot of people don’t like it. It’s got this genre of people, and you just don’t get it. You’ve got all different genres and people have different styles of singing, and I think people might be surprised that you can make this kind of song.
Todd L. Burns 
What was the reason for that?
Mike Paradinas 
Oh, I mean, I love the song. I have a lot of songs on there. I don’t like this one, but it’s good. I really, really love the song. I think everybody likes this song, and then I think people from all over the world pick it up as well. I think it’s just a really, really catchy song. I think that’s the reason. You know, if you’re from the USA, it’s not that popular. If you’re from Japan, you know, they don’t like it, but if you’re from Australia, you know that’s your thing. But I think people everywhere get more into the song and they want to do more, and I think that’s what we’re all about. I think the songs are always good. I think if you have a song that hits a lot of people, then it gets played a lot. I think that’s what I’m about when I’m writing songs. I’m always trying to get people to sing along with me, you know? If you have a track that hits a lot of people, and you can get people to sing along with you, then you have one that’s going to get played; and then if you have one that’s not going to get played, then whatever, it’s going to do. 
Todd L. Burns 
That was a big deal, and that was something that you guys had been talking about for years, and it was the first song you ever played on a radio show live.
Mike Paradinas 
Yeah.
Todd L. Burns 
The first song you ever played on a radio show?
Mike Paradinas 
Yeah, it was a radio show, but I don’t think they played it live, and I think they played it in a club. 
Todd L. Burns 
That was the same club that used to play “Big Time” by Neil Diamond, which was the first song that you ever ever played on a radio show. 
Mike Paradinas 
Yeah. That was the club that used to play “Big Time” by Neil Diamond. It was just on the radio, and I remember they played “Big Time” on the radio, and they had a big band, and they had a big audience. They had a lot of people from the USA and the UK, and they had a lot of people from different countries, and they had a lot of people from all over the world. 
I think that was the first time I ever played “Big Time” on a radio show live, because I think that was the first time I ever played “Big Time” live. It was the first time I ever played “Big Time” live, because I think that was the first time I ever played “Big Time” live. Todd L. Burns 
It’s like a Big Time, right? It’s like a, “Shit, you should hear something like this!” It’s like, ““Oh shit!” It’s like a big time. 
Mike Paradinas 
Yeah, it was big time. 
Todd L. Burns 
The first time you played it on a radio show was in the UK.
Mike Paradinas 
Yes. 
Todd L. Burns 
Did you have to think about it?
Mike Paradinas 
No, I was a radio DJ back then, and I think I had a radio show for about three weeks, and then I ended it and went to the bathroom. I didn’t think about it, but it
====================
“And the people who are doing this are not people who are going to be in the studio
with you, they are people like Kanye West.” I remember that one was super popular and I wanted
to do this record.
Todd L. Burns 
Were you working or did you just start recording?
Nile Rodgers 
I wasn’t working but I was just listening to music and I was like, “What do you mean?” I do all this
thing with my soul and I want to make this record and I want to give it a
different flavor and I want to keep it original.
Todd L. Burns 
What did you do to look like that?
Nile Rodgers 
When I was younger I was just a career whipper-jawed, sellout, weirdo kid.
Todd L. Burns 
Wasn’t that the case?
Nile Rodgers 
Yes, it was. I was not a professional musician. I wrote this record
because I wanted to be a professional musician and I wanted to be in a band, but I was
not sure what to do with my life.
Todd L. Burns 
For a moment, you were in a band and you had a band called The Dear Hunter?
Nile Rodgers 
Yes.
Todd L. Burns 
Were you at the same time?
Nile Rodgers 
No.
Todd L. Burns 
Was it a big band?
Nile Rodgers 
Yes, a big band. The Dear Hunter was
in New York at the time. I was like, “Well, this is not really what I would call a
band but it is a band and it is an interesting band, it is not
that I have no personality but it is a band and it is interesting because I
want people to feel like they are on the Dear Hunter.
Todd L. Burns 
You decided to go in a different direction?
Nile Rodgers 
No, I was not going in a different direction. I was not going to be in a band. I was going to be a
jazz singer and I was going to do records and I was going to do records with my own
voice and my own creative process.
Todd L. Burns 
You did a record with your own voice?
Nile Rodgers 
Yes. I did a record with my own voice and I recorded it on this analog
record. It was the first record I had ever done that I was proud of. I didn’t want to do
this record because I wanted to be a professional musician and I wanted to be in a band, but I wanted
to feel like I was on the Dear Hunter and I wanted to have people feel like they were
on the Dear Hunter.
Todd L. Burns 
Who was that?
Nile Rodgers 
That was a band called The Dear Hunter. What was it?
Todd L. Burns 
The Dear Hunter was a jazz group?
Nile Rodgers 
No, the Dear Hunter was an ensemble, it was a group in New York called
The Dear Hunter.
Todd L. Burns 
What was the name of the group?
Nile Rodgers 
The Dear Hunter, it was a jazz ensemble, it was called The Dear Hunter.
Todd L. Burns 
What was the name of the band?
Nile Rodgers 
The Dear Hunter was a jazz ensemble.
Todd L. Burns 
What was the name of the band?
Nile Rodgers 
The Dear Hunter was an ensemble of young people from New York.
Todd L. Burns 
I guess that is the name of the group?
Todd L. Burns 
The Dear Hunter was an ensemble of young people from New York who wanted to make jazz records.
Nile Rodgers

jazz records.

The Future is Now
by Danny B.
My love of music, of course, and obviously my love of books and all the things I was exposed to, I’m really into technology and I was thinking, “How can I use this technology to help people?” I mean, I’m a musician and I’m a software engineer, and I know all about working with computers and computers in the studio. I’ve worked with computers before and I have to say, it’s not that you can’t use them or they’ll be a bad band, but it’s kind of hard to be a musician without having a computer. That’s what I’ve been working with for years. I don’t know how to get into it but it’s about having computers, and having a computer is a good thing. If you don’t have a computer, you don’t have to worry about being a musician. 
I think that’s what I’ve been working for, for the past 10 years. And I’m not talking about making records or anything like that. I’m talking about just using technology. I’ve been using this technology for years and years. I’m doing the things I do and I still don’t know how to get into it. I’m trying to get into it, but I’m gonna have to start it. You know, I’m just trying to learn how to use the technology to help people. I’m going to have to start it and make sure I have a computer. I’m going to have to start it. I’m not going to tell you how to do it, but if you don’t have a computer, you don’t have to worry about being a musician. 
Gerd Janson
We’ve heard you sing quite a lot. 
Daniele Bortot 
Yes. I’m not good at singing. I can do all the notes, but when I sing it’s all about the notes. If you’re not good at singing, you’re not good at music. I don’t want to use the word musician, but I’m a musician. It’s not a profession. I just want to help people, and I’m going to help people. I’m going to help people. I’m not going to tell you what to do, but I’m here to help people. I’m just working on this in my spare time. I think that’s what I’m here for. 
Gerd Janson
Do you think you’ll be there for everybody? 
Daniele Bortot 
I’m sure I will be there. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. I’m sure I will. 
Gerd Janson
And are there any other people in the room, or are there other people from outside? 
Daniele Bortot 
I think that’s my job, to be able to work with people who’re really good at something. I’m not sure how to put that, but that’s what I’m going to do. I’m not going to be interested in doing something else or something, because I’m actually looking for something else. I’m working with my partner in Milan, a young man called Giuseppi, who’s a very talented guy, but he’s just not interested in anything else, and I’m not interested in anything else. I think that’s my job for the future, to be able to work with people who’re really good at something and who’ve got the possibility to do something else. 
Gerd Janson
So you think yourself a musician for the future? 
Daniele Bortot 
Yes. I think so, yes. I know I am. I’m still here and I’m taking care of this thing that I have. I’m just gonna have to work with it, for the next five years, just to get myself to the stage where I want to be. I’m not going to
====================
I’m going to say this and say this right now, this is the first project where I’ve actually made a song, and I’m not even sure if you guys know about it or that there’s been a record by that name, but I just want to say, you know what? I’m not going to let anybody tell me what I can do. I’m going to do my own thing. That’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to do my own thing. I’m going to make my own music. I’m going to be a different person. I’m going to do my own thing. I’m going to do the things I want to do. But you know what? I’m going to do my own thing, and if I get a good record out of it, that’s me and my music. If I don’t get a good record out of it, I’m not going to do it.

Todd L. Burns 
You mentioned that you were a fan of DJ Shadow. You are a fan of Shadow. You were a fan of Shadow.
DJ Shadow 
I mean, before that, I was a big fan of Shadow, too. I was a big fan of Shadow. I just wanted to do my own thing and do my own thing, but I wanted to do it just like I wanted to do it before. I didn’t want to be on the radio. I just wanted to do my own thing. But I just wanted to do it just like I wanted to do it before. It was just a matter of me and how I feel about music.
Todd L. Burns 
What do you feel about music when you put it to you?
DJ Shadow 
For me, it’s just music. It’s just like when you go into a club, and you go to a club, you can’t just sit there and listen to songs. You just want to dance. You want to dance. You want to dance. You want to be happy. You want to be happy. You want to be happy. There’s a reason why the music industry has become so, so good to me, that’s what I want to do. I wanna do my own thing. I wanna be myself. I wanna be me. I wanna be who I want to be.
Todd L. Burns 
You didn’t have to worry about records being too popular, or the industry or what?
DJ Shadow 
Honestly, I just didn’t have to worry about it. I just knew what I wanted to do. I just knew what I wanted to do. I knew what I wanted to do. I just wasn’t worried about popularity for anything. I just knew what I wanted to do. I just knew what I wanted to do. I just believe in myself. I just believe that I’m gonna do my own thing. I’ve never seen something like this in my life. I mean, I have two brothers, and I have a pretty good sense of humor. But I just didn’t have to worry about it. I just knew that I wanted to do my own thing.
Todd L. Burns 
How does your brother react to that?

Pusha T is one of the most polarizing rappers in hip-hop history. His name is always linked to hip-hop, especially when he comes through with the beats and he’s the founder of the Wu-Tang Clan. But unlike the other members of the Wu, who were among the most successful, influential rappers of their generation, Pusha T was an amateur rapper and a political activist. Growing up in Atlanta, Pusha T was a member of the Youth Out Of Mind Gang, a street gang whose members would take drugs and alcohol and do things that were considered drug-related. He talked about gang busts, drug-related violence and the drug war. But he was also a hip-hop producer and he was also an advocate for African-American youth and people of color. In his 2013 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, Pusha T talked about the Wu’s influence on his music and how it influenced him, the influence of his childhood, and his role in the Wu-Tang Clan. Produced by Tipsy T and featuring guest appearances by Juicy J, Dizzie Reddick, Q-Tip and more, this lecture, produced by Danny Brown, features a live performance by Zay, Kendrick Lamar, 2 Chainz, 2 Chainz, A$AP Rocky, Big Sean, Biz Mark, and more.

====================
Taylor Swift has proven herself to be one of the most trusted producers in hip-hop history, but for years she was sidelined in the industry. After she released her solo album, 2010's Red was released with a track listing that wasn't even her official track. She was deeply dissing the record label and the record company that released it. In her 2013 Red album, it was revealed that the record label was selling records that didn't have a track listing, and there was no recording of the album. Instead, it was a compilation that was released with a radio…
It has been almost a decade since Taylor released her debut album, and it is still one of her most controversial albums. It is considered the first rap record to be commercially released without a track listing, and it was released as a compilation, which is a sub-genre of hip-hop that is produced by those who have the resources to print the record. 
Taylor, who is the most successful artist in history, has done so much for the history of hip-hop. Hopefully, we can shed some light on how successful her rap career has been. 
(music: Taylor Swift – “Til The Bell Tops” / applause)
Torsten Schmidt 
I think we have a great opportunity to ask Taylor, as a person, what her greatest success was, and what was her greatest regret in the music industry? 
Taylor Swift
I think I came up with that. I think I came up with the idea of having a track listing, because I was living in New York, and I just thought, “Let’s just have a list and put the names of the records out there that are actually recorded.” That’s what I was doing. I wanted to make sure people knew what was going on, because I was living in New York, and I couldn’t really get in touch with artists because they had their entire catalog of records. I couldn’t go to their offices, I couldn’t talk to their managers or anything. I was like, “Alright, let’s just have a list of records, and just put them out there that have a track listing.” When you think about it now, you’d be surprised at how many artists are on that list. That’s why I think I was so successful, because I was living in New York, and I could get access to their catalog, so I could get access to the artists I wanted to work with, because they had whole catalogs of records that were just out of print. 
I feel like I got a big shot because I’ve been in New York for a long time. I’ve worked in New York for nearly three years, and I’ve been doing this for the past 10 years. I was living in New York, and I was still doing my music, but I wasn’t releasing music. I was just working at McDonald’s, and I was just doing my things. I was still doing my things, but I was just working at McDonald’s. I was also working at Starbucks, and I was still doing my music. I’m still working at Starbucks, but I was never going to get out of the city because I’ve been there for so long. 
Torsten Schmidt 
It’s been so long, and you’ve been in the city for so long. How did you feel when you first heard Taylor’s records? 
Taylor Swift
They were so good, they were so good, and I was like, “OK, I’m going to release my record.” I was just really excited to do something in this city. I was like, “Wow, this is something I can do.” I think I felt that way, too, because I’m living in New York, and it was just like I was getting the chance to be myself, because I was just like, “Alright, I’m going to release my album.” I had a lot of confidence in myself, so I just released it without a song listing. It was just like it was a compilation, and I thought, “Well, I like it.” I didn’t think it would be as popular as it was, but I did. 
Torsten Schmidt 
What kind of artists were you listening to at that time? 
Taylor Swift
I was listening to all the artists I knew from New York, and I was listening to all the artists I knew from New York, and I was listening to all the artists I knew from New York, and then just looking at all the artists that were still making music at that time, and I’m listening to all the artists that were coming out at the time. I was listening to
====================
I don’t know if you have a lot of people in your circle that you want to work with on a record, but if you do, do you wanna work with members of that group or do you wanna work with yourself?
Mike Paradinas 
It’s pretty easy to work with yourself. You’re not going to have any problems because you’re a complete unknown to the mainstream. That means you can be very successful and do what you want with your life. I don’t know, we’ve just been working with each other for a long time. We have a recording studio, we have a label and we’re making music. It’s all good. If you want to work with somebody, that’s your right. Don’t be afraid to work with people who you think can help you out, because you can’t really depend on anybody. Just put the music out as you want to and see what happens. What do you think about that?
Emma Warren 
I think it’s good to collaborate with people you know or have known for a long time, because if someone doesn’t like it, let them know. If you like something and you want to work with someone, just let them know. We have a label, we have a label, we have a label, we have a label and we’re working on music. It’s all good. It’s just people that are there to help you out, they don’t know anything about you but they’ll help you out if you’re struggling.
Mike Paradinas 
Yeah, that’s good. You don’t have to worry about your money, it’s all good.
Emma Warren 
What’s the latest album by the label, you know?
Mike Paradinas 
The latest album by the label, is out now on the label, is called The Trial, it’s a UK title. 
(music: Daytripper – “Woo-hoo” / applause) 
Mike Paradinas 
I just wanted to say I’m very grateful to them. I’ll be talking to them on the phone at the end. You can be very surprised when you see the track, because they’re doing their own thing.
Emma Warren 
You mentioned that you’ve worked with the label for a long time, what kind of record was that?
Mike Paradinas 
They work with music, they’re very, very well-known for themselves. They’re really good records. They’re very talented people. It’s very good to work with people like that.
Emma Warren 
You mentioned that there are a lot of bands around you, and what’s the big one that you want to work with?
Mike Paradinas 
There are a lot of bands, but it’s a really, very small one. The big one is a new artist by the name of Daytripper. He’s very talented and it’s a good time to work with him because he’s coming out with a new album. It’s gonna be out in December, but I wanted to say that I know this artist, he’s talented, I mean he’s very talented, but he’s a British guy, and he’s a very talented musician. He’s a very talented artist and I’ve known him since the early days. You can’t depend on anybody, just put the music out as you want to and see what happens. What do you think about that?
Emma Warren 
What do you want to work with when you’re out there?
Mike Paradinas 
I want to work with people who are really talented, and who are not just ... I’m not a musical super star, but you can’t just rely on them, just know what to put out there. It’s a good question.
Emma Warren 
How do you feel about your partner?
Mike Paradinas 
We’re friends, we’re good friends, but he’s not always there for me, he just has his own thing.
Emma Warren 
What kind of record would you like to work with with him on?
Mike Paradinas 
I just have a track called “Stairway to Heaven” and I’ve worked with him on it. I’ve worked with him on several records. I want to work with him again, I’m not going to be around forever, I don’t want to be around

Some of you may have heard that we had a recording session for a song we did with your voice. It was like a one-off. We used to do a recording session every year.
Gerd Janson
The first-ever live recording session that you did was with Kaspar Hauser, who was the lead producer in the studio.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
(music: N.W.A. – “Beat It (Beat It)” / applause)
Gerd Janson
Cool.
Chal Ravens
Thank you.
Gerd Janson
That was “Beat It,” which was recorded in the studio.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
And who was Kaspar Hauser?
Chal Ravens
He was the lead producer in the studio, I think.
Gerd Janson
He was a big producer in the studio.
Chal Ravens
Yes, but he was also one of the biggest producers ever, and he was big. We used to do a recording session every year. We had a recording session every year in the studio, and every year we would do a recording session in the studio. We used to do a recording session in the studio, and we would do a recording session in the studio and then we would do the recording session and then the recording session in the studio. We used to do a recording session in the studio, and then we would do a recording session. And we had a lot of songs on this album, we used to not put on music. We would just record songs and then we would take a song and put it on a CD, and then we would have a CD with the songs. And then we would go and record a song and then take a song off of the CD and put it on the CD. And we would do a recording session in the studio, and then we would do a recording session in the studio.
Gerd Janson
What is that?
Chal Ravens
That’s how it was, and we would do a recording session. And then we would go and record a song, and then we would record another song and then we would do a recording session in the studio.
Gerd Janson
But you say you would record in the studio?
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
It wasn’t just for you?
Chal Ravens
Yes, and we would record in the studio.
Gerd Janson
That was Kaspar Hauser, and it was recorded in the studio.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
That’s the best?
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
I mean, you’d never played it live!
Chal Ravens
Yes. We would do it live in the studio.
Gerd Janson
And you just did it in a room where people would listen to the record and then play it to you or have a drink?
Chal Ravens
Yes, but at that time we used to play the songs live.
Gerd Janson
We played them live!
Chal Ravens
Yes, but we would play the songs live in the studio. And then we would record the songs live in the studio.
Gerd Janson
Some of Kaspar Hauser’s songs were on the album, and some were not. You could hear that from the songs.
Chal Ravens
Yes, they were on the album, but it was mainly Kaspar Hauser, and it was for him, but it was for him as well. So, we had a lot of songs on this album that we used to record live in the studio.
Gerd Janson
Ah.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
We’ve talked about Kaspar Hauser, but I think you can’t remember the names of the artists that were on the album, but you can remember the names of Kaspar Hauser, and you can remember the songs.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
And that would be a lot of music, especially when you’re a little bit older.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
I mean, Kaspar Hauser is a huge producer who’s also one of the biggest producers ever.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
And he was also one of the biggest producers.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
And you were a big producer too, as well.
Chal Ravens
Yes.
Gerd Janson
And Kaspar Hauser is one of the biggest producers ever.
Chal Ravens
Yes.

The New York Times and Big Apple culture-spewing, progressive news organization have been collaborating for years in a pretty amazing way. Their collaboration has even included a collaboration with the Bronx Symphony Orchestra, which has recorded a number of their favorite songs on the radio, including Justin Timberlake’s “Diamonds” and Major Lazer’s “Bounce Back.
But that is not the end of the story. This morning, the Times’ editorial page CEO and publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., announced that he and his wife, Ann, are launching a new media company, Smith & Wesson, with a focus on bringing news into the homes of the masses.
Pressed on the matter in his annual address at the 2015 Red Bull Music Academy, the New York Times’ editorial page CEO argued that he and his wife’re not interested in catering to the poor or the mainstream. Rather, they want to take its place and give it a good "shake."
"We’re going to be a media company that can change the world and bring to life the works of art that we love. We want to be at the forefront of our times and have the same perspective that you have in your home," he said.
So, this is what they’re going to do, this is what they’re going to do, this is what they’re going to do and it is not the end of the road. It is a new beginning. We’re going to be a media company that can change the world. That’s why we choose to be here today. We want to be at the forefront of the things we put out. We are going to be a media company that is going to change the world.
There are seven things that we’re going to be doing together, which is going to be an evolution as well as a continuation, as we’re coming to realize, “OK, we can do something here.” This is why we’re here. We’re coming to realize there’s something else out there. We’re going to be bringing you the right stuff. We’re going to be bringing you the right news, if you’re there. We’re going to be bringing you the right music. We’re going to be bringing you the right folks and we’re going to be making it possible for you to be able to be able to be your best self. But we’re not going to cater to the wealthy or the establishment, we’re going to be in charge of the people and we’re going to be listening to you, we’re going to be following you. We’re going to be looking out for you. We’re going to be working with you and we’re going to be helping you.
That’s why we’re here and we’re going to be in charge of that. We’re going to be the media company that you want your music to be heard on, the people want to hear what you’re doing and they want to hear what else you’re doing. We’re going to be the media company that you want to be in charge of, because that’s where people want to hear what you’re doing.
We’re going to be in charge of the music business, because you can’t have your dream and your passion and your dreams and dreams be in the hands of an entertainment company, you can’t have your dreams and your passion and your dreams be in the hands of an entertainment company. You can’t have your dreams and your passion and your dreams be in the hands of an entertainment company. You can’t have your dreams and your passion and your dreams in the hands of an entertainment company.
That’s what we’re going to do. That’s what we’re going to do and we’re going to be a force to be reckoned with. It’s our dream, the dream of how much we want to do… we’re not going to let anyone tell us what we should be doing or what we should be doing. We’re going to be a force to be reckoned with and we’ll be able to make a fader, a beautiful fader, but we’re going to be able to make a fader that will be beautiful as well.

[laughter] I was like, “Yeah, sure.” But I was also like, “No, let’s just go to the clubs.” I didn’t feel like that was something I was doing. I was like, “No, I don’t want to go to clubs.” [laughter] I just didn’t feel comfortable in clubs. I was like, “Oh, my God, how am I gonna get here?” I just didn’t feel comfortable in clubs. I didn’t want to be in clubs. I just went to the clubs. I got to the club and just played music. I was like, “Oh, that’s cool, I didn’t have to go to the clubs, I didn’t have to go to the club.” Then I just went to the club and I was just like, “Have fun.” [laughter]
I guess I was very lucky to get into the club that I wanted to go to, so I just went to the club, and I just played music. It was just like, “Wow! What’s this?” “Oh, what’s that?” “Ah, what’s that?” “Yeah, I’m happy.” [laughter]

It was like, “What do you want to do, you know?” “I’m going to get my college degree,” “I’m getting my degree, but I’m gonna go to college.” “Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.” “OK, I’m going to get my college degree,” “OK, I’m going to get my degree, but my degree is still in college.” “Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.” “Well, what do you want to do?” “Oh, I’m playing music, but I’m not getting into the club.” “No, I’m not into the club.” “No, I’m not into the club.” “No, I’m not into the club.” “No, I’m not into the club.” [laughter]

The only thing that I had in common with all of those guys that were around at the time, was that I had been in a band called the Renegade Starship. When I was a kid I had dreamt of being an astronaut and going out with a parachute, but I was not an astronaut, but I was a stunt pilot and I could do a lot of things that my friends could not. I would go out and do things, and I would do stunts, which was not very good. I had to turn off the lights in the moment, and I would stand on the runway and make a stop sign, and then I would turn on the lights and go down the runway and go out. I was not a stunt pilot, but I was about as good as everyone else, and I was a good pilot. I would do stunts like that.
I would say, “You know what? I can fly a plane, but I don’t want to be a pilot.” But I did get the pilot training, and I would do some stuff. But I would do a lot of stunts, and then I would go back and do some more stunts. I would go in a plane and crash it. Doing stunts like that, and then I would go back to the studio to do more stunts, but I would not be a professional stunt pilot. I would be a stunt pilot, and I would be a good stunt pilot, but I would be a stunt pilot. I would be good at everything.

I guess it’s interesting, you talked a little bit about your father and how he’s always been around, and probably your mother, and how she’s always been around and is still around you, but in terms of your career as a stunt pilot, what are the things that you’ve done to help in your career as a stunt pilot?

My father was a pilot for the Air Force, and he was involved in the Space Shuttle program. He was the Deputy Principal of the School. He was in the Space Shuttle program, and he also served as the Flight Director for the Space Shuttle Program. He was also the Flight Director for the Space Shuttle, and he was the Flight Director for the Space Shuttle in the Air Force, and he was involved in the Space Shuttle program. He was a pilot... I guess a professional stunt pilot, and he wasn’t a stunt pilot, but he was a pilot for the Air Force, and he was involved in the Space Shuttle program. He was a stunt pilot, and he was a pilot for the Air Force, and he was involved in the Space Shuttle program.
Audience Member
So when your father was a pilot, he was involved in the Space Shuttle program?
TD
My father was a pilot, and he was involved in the Space Shuttle program. I mean, it would be a shame to have him die in the Space Shuttle, but it was a wonderful program, and I want to have him here today, and thank the Air Force for having him.

I guess it’s interesting, because it’s been said that you lived with your parents for quite a long time, and you had a lot of money, and you had a lot of things going on. But you also had a lot of people in your household that were involved in things, and you had a lot of people in your family, that were into music and that were into music, you had a good relationship with your parents, and your siblings.
But when you were growing up, there were a lot of people that you were involved with, and that’s what made you want to get into this kind of thing. You had so much money, and you had so much things going on. But you also had your family, and then you had a lot of people in your family that were involved in things, and that gives you a lot of motivation. You want to go out there and do things that people can’t do, and people won’t do, and people that won’t be around for a long time. And so what I did was I would go out there, and I would try to help out, and then I would try to make a record, or I would try to make a screenplay, or I would try to make some music, or I would try to make some movies, or I would try to make some television, or I would try to make some commercials.
But I’d always try to be a good, good role model for my siblings, and I’d always try to make it as easy as possible for them to get out there, and get into the world, and to do what they want to do.

So I guess it’s interesting because in terms of your family, what kind of role models do you have when it comes to
====================
I got to say, after a couple of years, my whole relationship to the music industry has changed in a way, because I got a lot of money by playing music. And I got to ask a lot of questions, because I was a DJ. And I'm not sure about the industry, the Internet, and everything. But I think the music industry is very closed-minded. And I don't think it should change, but I think people should make music for themselves, and not for the other people. And if you have a radio show putting out records, and you're reaching out to musicians, and you're making music with them, it's a very good thing. And I think I've done a lot of people in my life that have appreciated that. And I think going back to that, I'm an independent artist, so I don't really know what the industry is going to do now. But I do know what I want to do. And it’s not about making money, it’s about giving people something to do and not having to be like, “Oh well, I’m a DJ.” I want to make music for people, and I want to do it the way I want to do it. And I want to make it beautiful, and I want to do it at a really high level. And I want to have fun in the process, and I want to have fun, and I hope people will enjoy it. But I don’t want to be treated as this, I mean, I’m not going to be like, “Oh no, I’m not going to be a DJ.” I want to be treated like anyone else. And I wish that I could afford to go to the whole world tour, because maybe if I go to the World Cup in England and Germany, and I go to Japan and South Korea, or if I go to Korea, or the Philippines, because they have some of the best festivals, then I’ll go to all of those places. But in the end, I don’t want to be like, “Oh no, I’m not DJing, I’m just a DJ.” I don’t want to be like, “Oh no, I’m not a DJ.” I don’t want to be in a band. I want to be on my own. And I think that’s what I want. Because I think so many people are doing the same thing. And I think that’s really kind of sad, because what’s the point of having a band, if you want to be a successful musician? Because if you have a band, if you want to be a successful musician, you have to have a success story, and you have to have a record deal, and you have to have a career. And I don’t think the band industry is going to be any different. And if they do, I’m not sure if they’re going to help either. Because if it’s not going to help, then the money is going to stop coming in. I don’t want to be like, “Oh no, I don’t want to be a DJ.” Because you know, I think it’s going to make it harder to be successful. And I think I’m going to be doing it the way I want to do it, and I want to do it the way I want to do it. And I hope that’s true for everyone. And if you’re going to make it, you have to make sure you’re making it right. And I hope that you’ve enjoyed your time here. And it’s always good to get back to work.

Hi, I don’t know if you can give us a little bit of advice on things, because you’ve been on a tour for a long time. Maybe just give us a little bit of words on what you’ve seen and done, as well. And then we go from there. I think that’s the best advice we have. I just want to say that everyone here is doing it for themselves. And I think at the end, if you’re an independent artist, you have to be able to look in the mirror and say, “I got to do it the way I got to do it,” because you don’t have to give up on yourself. And I believe that’s what is so important, because it’s not about how many money you have, it’s about how you treat yourself, and how you treat others. And I’m not going to be a DJ, I’m not going to be a

====================
The United Kingdom was chosen as the birthplace of electronic music. We made our mark in electronic music, music in general, and music in particular, in the UK, in the late ’80s to ’90s. We started out in a very small two-storey studio in Oxford, a place where we were very independent, and we had no studio equipment. Our music was very experimental and we would try new things. 
We were on our own as well, having no studio equipment. We would work very hard on our music and we tried new things. We tried electronic music, and we were very experimental. 
Maurice Fulton, the engineer and I were pioneers in electronic music, and we had no studio equipment. We were making music with our own instruments, and we traveled around the world in our very expensive plane. We had no equipment. We did live, and we had a lot of free time. We’d work for free. We didn’t have anything. The people in the UK, they were very supportive, and they were kind of like, “Well, you’re a musician.” They’d listen to your music, and they’d spend money. The people in the United States, they wouldn’t spend a dime, they just ... 
They felt it was a performer, and they’d spend money on it.

What were you listening to when you were growing up? 
Roy Ayers
We were listening to Kraftwerk, and we were listening to Space, and we were listening to EBM. We were listening to Funkadelic. We were listening to a lot of different music, but we were listening to the same. We were listening to everything. 
All of us, we were listening to music from the same place. We were listening to Radiohead, Jay-Z, for example, and we were listening to Nirvana. There was a lot of people from all over the world. If you’re an American in the UK, you have your friends. If you’re in the States, you have your friends. You’re friends with your friends, and you’d have your friends with you. 
We were listening to each other’s music, and we were listening to what was coming from the UK. The UK had no internet, and at that time, there was no internet. It was only download and play. We had our own computers, and we had our own Rave. We had our own music. We had our own records. We had our own DJs. We had our own mixes. We had our own equipment. 
We were listening to all kinds of music. We were listening to everything. We were listening to everything. We had no problems, we were just friends, just as we are now.

We didn’t start to share electronic music. We just started to share electronic music.
