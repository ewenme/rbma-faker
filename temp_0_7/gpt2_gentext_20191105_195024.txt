I mean, I think there’s so many traditions that you can have in music. Some of them, you have to be like a jazz musician. Some of them have to be like a rock band, because that’s what I’m trying to do, I’m trying to express something. I think I’m doing it. I’m trying to express something.
Audience Member 
I mean, I don’t know, I’m just curious. I mean, what do you mean? You’re saying, “I mean, I don’t know, I always listen to jazz players, but I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Seth Troxler 
Well, quite frankly, I don’t think I can say I listened to jazz. I’ve always listened to music, but I’m not a fan of jazz as a genre. It’s just that I like the music, but I don’t like jazz as a genre.
I mean, I like the music, but I think jazz is just an extremely old-fashioned genre. It’s not as old-fashioned as the rock band, the country band, or whatever. I don’t want to say it’s necessarily a bad genre, but I think it’s just a genre that’s just been around forever.
I mean, I listen to jazz. When I was a kid, I was always into jazz, but I don’t think I could listen to jazz as a genre. It’s just that I like the music, but I’m just not into it. I like rhythm. I love jazz, but I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Other than that, I’ve always been into rock. I’ve always been into jazz, but then I’m into country music. If I’m going to go to the store for a hamburger, I’m going to go the Country Club, but I don’t want to go to the Country Club, I’m going to go to the Country Club. I’m not going to the Country Club, I want to go to the Country Club. I’m not going to the Country Club, I want to go to the Country Club.
I’m like, “Come to Florida, we’re going to go to the Country Club.” “Come to Florida, we’re going to go to the Country Club.” “Come to Florida, we’re going to go to the Country Club.” “Come to Florida, we’re going to go to the Country Club.” I’m like, “Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.”
I mean, I’m sure there’s different people out there, but I think I’m going to go to the Country Club, but it’s really a mystery. Nobody really knows what they’re talking about. I don’t think I’m going to go to the Country Club because it’s just too old, I don’t think I’m going to go to the Country Club because it’s too old, I don’t want to go to the Country Club because it’s just too old.
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. I don’t know, I don’t know.
Audience Member 
And it’s a very popular club in this area, I guess.
Seth Troxler 
I mean, that’s a big question.
Audience Member 
Yeah.
Seth Troxler 
Yeah.
Audience Member 
Can you tell us about the history of the club?
Seth Troxler 
The history of the club is there are stories about it. It’s really a story that goes back to the early ’60s, when we were kids, when I was still at school. There was a big dancehall scene in New York. It was just like, “Ah, that’s cool, that’s dope,” and then there was the crews in New York, and it was like, “Oh, this is dope, this is cool,” and then there was the house music scene, which was the scene of the house music. It was just like, “Oh, this is cool, this is dope,” and then there was the, “Oh, this is dope,”
====================
”No, this is a recording of a soundsystem and it doesn’t sound like a house.” 
[laughter]
Mike Paradinas
It’s a recording of a soundsystem.
[laughter]
Mike Paradinas
I think it’s a good example of a recording that’s not like a house. There’s nothing that’s like a house. I mean, a lot of soundsystems, they’ll play a record and have a bunch of people in the background. They’ll have a guy playing guitar, a guy doing fader sweeps, a guy playing sequencers. They’ll play a record and have a bunch of people in the background,” but they’ll have a guy playing guitar, a guy doing fader sweeps, a guy playing sequencers. [laughter]
[laughter]
Mike Paradinas
And I see it like that every now and then, I see stuff, I’m like, “Fuck, I really like this.” Like, for example, Star Wars, we played a record on the radio. It had a track called “What Is A Jedi?” Star Wars is a science fiction movie. It had a track called “A New Hope,” Star Wars is a science fiction movie. There’s a record called “Star Wars,” and then a record called “Star Wars,” and then we play the star wars record, the Star Wars record. And that’s a great example of a record, because I saw it in a movie theater, we played it and it was a good example of a record from a soundsystem.
[laughter]
Mike Paradinas
And of course, for me, the thing about a record is it’s not about the popularity of it, it’s not about the amount of money. It’s about the quality of it, and that’s what I try to do. I’m not going to pretend that I can do a record like that, but if there’s any music that I think people can relate to, they can relate to, they can relate to, they can relate to. “What Is A Jedi?” it doesn’t have to be a pop song, it doesn’t have to be a rock song. It’s just a record, you know? That’s what I try to do. 
[laughter]
[laughter]
Mike Paradinas
And it’s also about the presentation, the way you make your music, the way you put it together. It’s about the way you put it together. If you put it in a form, or if the artist put it together, it’s a record. If they put it together, it doesn’t have to be a pop record, it’s just a record. And if you put it out, it’s a record, it doesn’t have to be a pop record. 
[laughter]
[laughter]
Mike Paradinas
It’s about the presentation. And if you put it out, it’s a record, and if they put it out they’ll be buying more records. And if you put it out, it’s a record. And if you put it out, it’s a record, it doesn’t have to be a pop record, it just has to have a presentation. 
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
Mike Paradinas
It’s just about the presentation.
[laughter]
[laughter]
Mike Paradinas
I think everyone can have a personality, just like they can have a soundsystem. You can have a soundsystem, it just depends on what you want it to sound like. I think that people can have a soundsystem with a house, they can have a house with a beat, they can have a beat with a club, they can have a beat with a disco, they can have a disco with a house. I think that has to do with the way you put it together.
[laughter]

Now, if you want to show us some of the people that produced some of the biggest records you want to show off, I think maybe we can give a couple of names up.

It’s a little sad.

It’s a little sad, the people that produced some of the biggest records. I think of that, the fact that
====================
Javier Molina, CUP
The reaction to your music was so strong that you were invited to play in London ’cause of some performance problems.
Thomas Newson
It’s a lot to ask for. I don’t know how I got here, but the producers were so good to me!
Javier Molina
Yeah.
Thomas Newson
I mean, I think, for us, we kind of started out as a little producer and just kind of grew into it. I think I was forced to learn to be a producer because I was making records and the producers were like, “This is what you do, you make records.” I would say what I did was, I was a producer and I was producing records. I think I would have been a producer if I wasn’t pushed into it by producers, because if you are a producer, you are going to be there. But you know, I’m not going to lie to you, it’s a lot to ask for, but at the same time, I think if you do it, you learn something along the way, and if you don’t, you’re just going to be living with it as long as you should.
Javier Molina
Yeah. I mean, this is what I learned from it. I think I learned a lot from it. I think I learned how to be a producer, because I was doing so much, and I was trying to do so much, and I was just trying to keep it interesting. I would say what I did was kind of interesting because I was like, “What do you do?” I was really into it. I was like, “This is what I do.”
Thomas Newson
I think you were talking about being on a label, and you were on a label almost every year.
Javier Molina
I was on the label for about a year. I would say I was on the label for about a year and a half. I was on the label for like three years, and I was a producer, so I was doing a lot of stuff and I was doing a lot of tracks. I was always making tracks, and it was just going to be a long, long time to be on a label, and I was constantly on the label. I was always producing, and I was always working on tracks. I was always playing their records. I was playing their albums and their best records, and it was just a beautiful experience. I was just hit by the magic, from producers and DJs, and I was just kind of introduced to the world.
For me, I was introduced to the world of music, and I was introduced to the world of producers, and I was introduced to the world of DJs. It was just a really, really wonderful experience, and I was really lucky to be there.
Thomas Newson
As a producer, you are going to be doing a lot of things.
Javier Molina
I was done producing at that point. I was done with the whole label. I was done with the whole, “I don’t know,” thing. I was done with the whole, “You don’t know what I’ve done,” thing. I was done with that. I was done with the whole, “I don’t know what this is,” thing. I was done with that.
I was at that point, and I was just kind of ready to be finished with it. I was just ready to go. I was at that point in my career, and I was just feeling the energy of it. I was happy about it. I was happy about that. I mean, I was never happy about anything. I was always happy about my music. I was always happy about the people that I met and I just really liked the people I met. I just really liked the people I met. I just really liked the people I encountered. I just wanted to be happy, and I wanted to be on a label that was just never going to be finished, and I wanted to be happy. It wasn’t going to be finished, and it wasn’t going to be finished. I wanted to be happy, and I just wanted to be happy.
I wanted to be happy. I wanted to be happy, and I wanted to be happy. I have this whole thing of not wanting to be happy, and I didn’t want to be happy about anything. I wanted to be happy, and to be happy was just my thing. I wanted to be happy, and I wanted to be happy, and that was what I wanted to be. I just wanted to be happy, and I wanted to be happy.

But you have to remember, you have to

====================
A few years ago, I was in the studio with a couple of different producers and I was working with several different producers who were actually working with my label at the time. I was working with the label and the producer was working with the label, and they were working with each other. And then we had one label that was playing my records, and I was playing them for a couple of people with the label. Then we had a label that was playing my records, and then I was playing them for a couple of people with the label, and then I was playing them for a couple of other people. And I was being very much into the label and the producer, so I was always looking for a little bit of a break. And I was working with them for quite a while. And then I got a job with a label that I was really into, and then I got a job at a label that is playing my records for a couple of people, and I was doing the same thing myself, just off the back of those jobs. I was doing a festival for a label that was playing my records for a couple of people, and then I was doing a club for the label that was playing my records, and then I was doing a club for the label that was playing my records for a few people. And then I was doing a festival for another label that was playing my records for a couple of people, and then I was doing a club for another label, and then I was doing a DJ for the label that was playing my records for a couple of people. And I was doing a party for the label, and then I was doing a club for the label. And then I was doing a DJ for the label. And then I was doing a house party for the label, and then I was doing a house party for the label, and then I was doing a club for the label. And then I was doing a house party for the label, and then I was doing a festival for the label. And then I was doing a DJ for the label. And basically, that was all that was going on. And that was my job. That was my goal. I was just doing what I wanted to do, and that was all. And then, once I was doing that, I was doing my thing, and then I was just taking care of all the other things that I did. And that was my job. 
Torsten Schmidt  
So when did you start to feel like, maybe we should cut to the chase here? There is a few different tracks that you have on the record that are in there. You have a few different tracks on here that are basically just like, “Hey, there is a lot of different stuff going on at the time, and we need to get back to the basics.” 
Serko Fu  
Yeah. 
Torsten Schmidt  
And you have a couple of songs that you have in there, and then there is the whole thing of the label, and the whole thing of the festival, and the whole thing of doing parties, and then just the whole story of just being in a club, and doing parties. 
Serko Fu    
It was just after that, I was in a club for about six months, and then I had a job at a label. And then I had a job at a house party for about six months, and then I had a job at a club. And then I went to a club and I was just enjoying myself. And I didn’t know what to do, to be honest. I was just enjoying myself. And then I got back into the studio with the label and the producer, and then I got back into the studio with the club. And then I got back into the studio with the DJ, and then I was back into the studio with the DJ. And then I was back into the studio with the label and the producer, and then I was back into the studio with the DJ. And then I was back into the studio with the DJ, and then I was back into the studio with the DJ. And then I was back into the studio with the DJ. And then I was back into the studio with the DJ, and then I was back into the studio with the label and the producer. And then I was back into the studio with the DJ, and then I was back into the DJ. And then I was back into the DJ, and then I was back into the DJ. And then I was back into the DJ, and then I was back into the label. 
Torsten Schmidt    
And you have a lot of different genres. 
Serko Fu    
Some of the DJs in here could definitely change the game. We were doing house, and house was being played over, and it was like house is very, very similar to house music. It was a very, very
====================
Bravery is a word often used in the United States to describe being brave, but it is also used to describe being good at something, being smart, being full of shit and more. There are many different ways to do that.
I think most of the time, I don’t know, I just think that a lot of it comes from a lack of understanding. People have a vision, and if they don’t understand that vision, there’s no way they’ll do it. There’s no way they’ll get to their goal. I think I’ve seen a lot of people… I’m not trying to be too negative, but some people that are not as strong as they could be, they just don’t see it the way that I see it. It’s hard to see, if you’re not a little bit proud of yourself and you think you can do it, and you don’t have the resources, it’s just not going to happen. If you’re the underdog, it’s just not going to happen. You just don’t have the resources or a lot of nukes.
If you’re a really high, high-ranking person, you have to go through the process of understanding what you have. It’s just not going to happen, unless there’s a vision. If you have the vision, you can’t just hope for it to happen if it doesn’t. You have to be kind of bold, but you have to go through the process and you have to have a plan.
Torsten Schmidt 
I think for a lot of people it’s been really difficult to promote your music, because you are a popular singer, a popular artist, and you’ve done albums, you’ve done a lot of touring and stuff. Obviously, you’re not too well known in terms of your music and your life, but you’re also a musician, you’re a fashion designer, and you’re a producer. You’ve done so much and you’ve done it so well on your own. I know you’re a big fan of having a crew or a crew of people around you, and that’s always been there for you.
Nataliya Vasilyeva 
Yeah, I’ve got a crew of friends, and I don’t know what they do or what they do for a living, but I think we are all good. We’ve got a lot of very good friends.
Torsten Schmidt 
You’re talking about a band called the All-Star Crew, right?
Nataliya Vasilyeva 
I’m talking about a band called the All-Star Crew, and they’re from New York, they are a big band, and they’re a big band. They do so much for themselves, and their music is so important to them, they are so good, they’re so talented. They did so much, and that’s what I’m talking about: They’re talented, and they’re strong. They’re open to all kinds of experiences, and that’s something to be proud of.
Torsten Schmidt 
It’s interesting because you’re both a fashion designer and a producer, right?
Nataliya Vasilyeva 
I’ve always been a fashion designer, but I’ve also been a producer, I always have been a producer. I’ve always been a fashion designer, but I don’t know if people know that I work in the fashion world. I’m producing music, and I’m doing a lot of tours. I’m doing productions, and I’m doing shows, and I’m doing all kinds of things. I’m a producer, I never wanted to be a musician, I never wanted to be a performer, I never wanted to be a stuntwoman. I wanted to be a DJ. I never wanted to be a singer, I never want to be a dancer, I never want to be a stripper, I never want to be a hot model. I wanted to be an actor, I wanted to be a model, I wanted to be a musician. I’m doing all these things. I’m doing all kinds of things. I always wanted to be there for people, and I always will.
Torsten Schmidt 
I’ve been thinking about the All-Star Crew for a long time, and it’s such a great honor to be in that group and it’s such a great honor to be a part of

====================
So, when you’re in the studio trying to record something, what can you do to give yourself some peace of mind?
Benji B 
I’m very happy, I’m very happy, I’m very happy, I’m very happy, I’m very happy, I’m very happy, I’m very happy, I’m very happy.
Emma Warren 
I mean, the idea of getting your own music out there is something that’s still going strong for you, right? What has the show really done for you in terms of making music?
Benji B 
I can’t put a number on it, but I’ve made a lot of music, I’ve made a lot of music. And I’ve made a lot of money, I’ve got a lot of money, but I’ve also made a lot of mistakes, which is good. I’ve made a lot of money from this music. So it’s good, I can’t put a number on it, but I’ve made a lot of money. And I have to say, the first album that I did in a club, I didn’t know that I was gonna make it. So, I was in the country, I just got the music, I put it on the internet, I put it on SoundCloud, I put it on iTunes, I put it on Spotify, I put it on YouTube, I put it on
Every time I go out, I’m gonna put it on every other platform I have. I think that’s what I’ve done and I’m proud of it, I’m proud of it. But I think I’ve done a lot for myself and I’m really proud of it. I’ve made a couple of records, I’ve made a couple of albums, I’ve been in a lot of situations where I’ve had to do what I do every day, and I haven’t had a lot of success, but I’ve been in a lot of situations where I’ve had to do what I do every day. I feel like I’m making a lot of music, I’m doing a lot for myself and I’m just really proud of it.
Emma Warren 
I mean, you’ve got the Rolling Stones, you’ve got the Quicksilver Messenger Service, you have the Retro-A-Go-Go. You have all these things. What are the experiences that you’ve had that you’ve found to be good, to be honest?
Benji B 
I think I’ve had two negative experiences in my life. One was that, when I was making the music, I was making a rap, I was on the streets, I was living on the streets, I couldn’t work out a living. I had a lot of bad luck with that. I had a lot of bad luck with that, I had to get out of it and get help. I ended up getting a job. And I was still living on the streets. I was still going to the homeless shelter, I was still living on the streets, but I wasn’t working at that time. So, when I was out of the music business, I had to go back in the business, and I ended up not getting out of it, but I saw a lot of great things in the industry. And, you know, I was fortunate enough to be able to do what I was able to do, and I saw great things in the industry, but I had to go back into the music business to get out of it.
Emma Warren 
I think what you said is, you have to do what you’re capable of, and it’s not only about money, it’s about what you’re doing in the music industry. And, also, you have to have a positive attitude, and you have to have a positive attitude towards people, because you’re just dealing with people who’ve shown you the wrong way.
Benji B 
Yeah, I mean, obviously that’s a pretty important part of being a DJ, and that’s what I’ve always done, and I’ve never done anything else, but I’ve seen the positive things, and I’ve seen the bad things, and I’ve seen the bad things, and I’ve seen the things that I’ve seen in my life, and I’ve seen things that I’ve seen in my life, and I’ve seen

A few years ago I was working on a film as a key man for a local music group. I had a great opportunity to work on that film on a short film, but I wasn’t able to do it on a feature film. I only did it as a key man.
With this film I wanted to do something that would have a soundtrack and a DVD with it. I thought the people who would listen to it would be the musicians, who would be the producers. I thought they would be the fans, who would be fans of the film. In the end it just didn’t work out.

I was wondering if you could like share a little bit of a history of your music and your production of music for movies.

I was working on a feature film, but I didn’t do it. I just did it on a short film.
I guess for people, who just don’t know, I’ve always been a producer, a movie producer, a producer. I’m often asked about who is the best producer in the world, and I’m always happy to say I’m the best. When I’m on the road, I’m always surprised at the people who ask, “Who is the best producer in the world?” I’m like, “I’m the best producer ever,” but my producer friends, they’ll ask, “Who is the best?” I’m like, “I’m the best producer ever.” But when I come home I ask them, “What do you think?” I’m like, “I think you’re right, I think you’re right.” I’m making music for movies, I’m not making music for television. I’m making music for television, but I’m not making music for films. I’m making music for television, but I’m not making music for films. I’ve never done it. I was working on a feature film when I was making this film, and I had two years and a half to make it.
I think the people who are making films are always looking for something that’s going to impress, and they’re looking for something that’s going to be interesting to watch. I think it’s important to know about the people who are making the film, because they’ll help you. I think that’s what I’m trying to do, I’ve always had that desire to be able to be very, very interesting, and I’m always trying to be like that.

Well, I hope we can get to the obvious question, but why make a movie about the music scene in Chicago?
A few years ago I was working on a film as a key man for a local music group. I had a great opportunity to work on that film. It was the first film I ever worked with a director, and I read the script and I just thought this is a very special film. When I came in to work on it, I was shocked, because it was somebody's home movie. I just saw it the way a lot of people see it, and I wanted to be able to tell the story and I wanted to be able to be able to tell the story in a way that can be relatable to people. I was working on the film as a key man. I could tell the story of the music scene in Chicago, and I wanted to tell the story of that scene, and I wanted to be able to tell the story of the culture that was in that area.
When I came in, I was working on a feature film, and I had a great opportunity to work on it. I wanted to do it, but I didn’t know it would be good. I didn’t know it would be so well made. I didn’t know it would be so well made, but I wanted to do it. I wanted to make it, and I’m very proud of it.
I’m working on a feature film, and I’ve never done it before. I’ve never done it as a key man. I’m glad to have it. I’m glad to be doing it. I’m glad to be working with a film director, but I’m not glad to be
====================
The
instructions are really… The direction and the direction of the
singers are very important, always. It’s very important when singing to do something very clear.
I don’t know if you’ve ever heard a song like that before, that got so
bad that you’re in the studio and you’re listening to the lyrics and you’re
being really, really, really serious about it. And if you go to a restaurant and you go to eat something,
’cause you never want to be
dinner-waitress’ and you never want to be a waitress, but you have to
try to do the dishes, because it’s not going to be good in the restaurant and you’re
going to get the bad food. And then you’re going to leave your beer in the
bottle, but you have to drink it and then you’re going to leave the beer in the
bottle, so you’re going to get the junk food. So I mean, it’s very important to focus on
the lyrics, because if you really want to get away from the verses, the
singers, and you are just trying to be very, very analytical about it, you’re
going to get really hammered. You’re going to get really hungry. You’re going to go to the bathroom
and you’re going to poop, so you’re going to get really, really, really, really, really,
really hungry. And if you try to do anything else than just try to get away
from the lyrics, you’re not going to be successful. And if you’re trying to do a
song like that, music is an important part of it. And if you just read a book or whatever,
you’re not going to be successful. And if you’re making a song or a soundtrack or whatever,
you’re not going to be successful. Because if you can just read the lyrics, you’re
going to be successful. But if you can read the lyrics, it’s not going to be a
music. It’s just going to be a visual image. But if you want to listen to
a song, and I’ll tell you, that’s where my focus is. I don’t care what
you’re listening to, I’m listening to music. I’m listening to music that is taking my life
way too much. And if I’m doing a song and I’m going to do an instrumental, I’m going to do an instrumental,
and if I’m doing a song and I’m going to do an instrumental, I’m going to do an instrumental. But
when I’m playing an instrumental, I’m going to take the sound, I’m going to take the
feel, the idea, and I’m going to take the emotion, and I’m going to take the
strum, and I’m going to take the melody, and I’m going to take the lyrics, and I’m
going to take the melody, the lyrics, and when I do it, I don’t know if you’re
going to buy it, and I don’t know if you’ll buy it, but I’m going to
take all that and put it into a song, and when I do an instrumental, I’m going to take
the melody, and I’m going to take the lyrics, and I’m going to take the tone, and I’m
going to take the strum, and I’m going to take the melody, and I’m going to take the tone,
and then I’m going to take the strum, and I’m going to take the rhythm, and I’m going
to take the strum, and then the melody, and then I’m going to take the lyrics, and I’m
going to take the tone, and then when I do it, I’m going to take the melody,
and then I’m going to take the strum, and then the strum, and then I’m going to take the strum,
and then when I do an instrumental, I’m going to take the melody, and I’m
taking the strum, and I’m going to take the melody, and I’m taking the
strum, and then the strum, and then I’m
====================
The first ones in Toronto, the Barrington, were made in Toronto, so you’d have to be from there to make them here. The Barrington, they were made in Toronto, so there was a lot of people who came. These are the ones that you would have to buy, the ones that you would have to buy from the City of Toronto.
And I mean, they were not particularly big, so they were still very small. So they were always appreciated. And they were always made to be made in Toronto. I mean, that’s where the bulk of the production was made – because it was the place that I worked.
Emma Warren
But you also worked on your own label, like, “Whoa, that’s so weird.”
Company
Yeah, I had a label called Company, and I worked on my own label and I worked on the label for a long time. It was my first real label in Toronto, and I worked for a long time, so they were very nice to me. They had a very nice place to work and a nice atmosphere. And I was never in a hurry. I never worked too much, I never worked too little, just to get my own label. And I think I did it for a nice environment.
Emma Warren
I mean, you have your own label, you’re making your own music, you’re working with your own producers and you’re doing your own labels.
Company
Yeah, I’m very lucky to work with a great company, and they're a great label.
Emma Warren
You were talking earlier about making your own music and having your own label, and you’re using your own labels and doing your own labels.
Company
Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, I mean I used to make my own music, because I had a very good feeling about it. I’ve always been a producer for the most part, so I’ve been through a lot. I’m a great producer, I’m a great songwriter, I’m great producer. I think I’m even a great artist producer, because I always make original music and I always try to make something original.
Emma Warren
I mean, you’re also known as a producer for a long time.
Company
Yes, I’m a producer, I’m a producer, I’m a songwriter, I use my own label. I’m not going to use the same label, I’m going to use a different label. I’m going to have my own label. I’m going to have my own label, so all the people who are familiar with my label, they know what I’m talking about. I’m going to have my own label. So, yeah, yes, I’m a producer.
Emma Warren
Do you want to talk a little bit more about that, as well?
Company
Oh yeah.
Emma Warren
You were talking about that in your interview with me earlier, that you were a producer and you used to make your own music and you were able to do it.
Company
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Emma Warren
And you said you’re really not worried about making a record just because of the money. You said you don’t care about the money, you just want to make your music because that’s something that you’re passionate about.
company
Yeah, I mean, I’m still passionate about it, because I think that’s where I’m at. I know that I’ve been lucky enough to be able to put out records that I think are great records that people want to hear. I know that people want to hear them, so I think that’s my main focus right now is to make records that people want to hear. I want to make records that people want to hear. I want to make records that people want to hear. I want to make records that people want to hear. And that’s what’s important to me right now is to make records that people want to hear.
Emma Warren
Do you have a track that you want to play us that you’d like to play, or are you going to play it?
Company
Yeah, I think it’s good to play different things.
Emma Warren
What is that track?
Company
Yeah, it’s called “Love and Sex.”
Emma Warren
“Love and Sex.” 
Company
Yeah.

He was talking about film. I was a music student during the Cultural Revolution in China. I was a film student during the Cultural Revolution in Japan.

I was a film student during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. I was a music student during the Vietnam War. I was studying at the University of Tokyo. It was a time of revolution, of conflict and of war, the Cultural Revolution.    
Keiji Haino 
So when I heard about the Cultural Revolution, I was interested in movies, because as a child I was fascinated with movies. I saw movies like Akira and, to me, those were very interesting times. The Vietnam War, we were very much involved in the Vietnam War. It was very exciting. And the Cultural Revolution in China was very interesting because we were trying to change the way of thinking and the way people thought. We had to do this film, this movie. It was very tough. It was very risky. And we had to do it in China, because we had no audience there. That was very difficult. But it was a time when people were trying to change the way they thought, the way people thought.    
Audience Member 
I was really curious about how you work on a film that is so often a big cultural event.

That is the most important thing, that I am a composer. I am a songwriter. I am a film critic. I am a film maker. I am a critic. I am a composer. I am a director. I am a film maker. I am a critic.

====================
I have to say, it’s not all about the fact that it’s a big band, it’s not about it being an indie band, it’s not about it being a label, it’s about it being a good record, and even if you’re not, you still can’t help but be a part of it. It’s just about that.

I think people that’re not aware of it, it doesn’t really matter what label you buy it from, it just doesn’t matter what you pay. It’s not about whether you’re getting a record, it’s about whether you’re getting a good record. If you’re wondering whether you’re getting a good record, just buy a record. If you’re not getting a good record, you better ask the label if you’re getting a good record, because an indie band can’t be happy with just any record. If you’re not getting any good records, you’re not going to do well. It’s about what you put out.

It doesn’t matter if you’re being paid to be a record, if you’re getting a good record or not, it’s just about that. If you’re getting a record, just make sure you have it on your records. Don’t be afraid to put something out, because the difference between being a good record and being a great record is always there. It’s not just about whether it’s a good record or not, it’s about whether you’re getting a good record. If you’re getting a good record, you’re going to have to work harder to get the money that you need. A lot of times, you don’t want to be a record that’s a standard indie release, a standard double album release, because it’s going to be forgotten about. It’s just that you’re not a good record, you’re not playing it to a huge audience, you’re not playing it to major labels, you’re not playing it to big festivals, you’re not playing it to big radio stations. You’re not playing it to a lot of people. If you’re not playing it to the big label, and they think it doesn’t have a place in that, that’s not good.
I think if you’re not playing it, and you’re getting some big money, it’s just not going to work. You’re just getting your money and getting some other stuff. Just be ready.
Todd L. Burns
What do you think of the current state of the industry?
Tasha Tagaq
It’s so much more positive now, and I think that’s true sign of getting a good record. You don’t have to worry too much about the industry, it’s just an industry. We’re in a great place right now. It’s just a business, it’s not a musical industry, it’s not a music industry. It’s just a business. If you’re going to be a musician, you’re going to do it right, and you’re going to give it your best shot.
Todd L. Burns
Do you have any advice for people that are trying to do the same thing as you?
Tasha Tagaq
If you’re trying to do it right, you’re going to go in the studio and hire a good mastering engineer, and you’re going to do it the right way, you’re going to do it the right way, and you’re going to do it the right way. If you’re trying to do it right, you’re going to have to practice a lot, and you’re going to have to practice with your equipment. I think you just have to get into your own studio, and practice a lot.
Todd L. Burns
You worked in a small record studio before, but what was it like in there?
Tasha Tagaq
It was very small, but it was also very cool. It was a place that people could come to if they wanted to have a good record. It wasn’t a big place, it was just a small studio with a small, small audience. I think that’s the way it should be, and it’s not really a big club, it’s just a small space.

This is a post from the Radiohead Experience. 
(music: Radiohead – “Last Kiss”)
I’m not sure if you guys know who I am, but I was like a second generation Jamaican, and I was all over the place, I had a lot of friends, and I would just sit in this great jungle of London, and we would all go to the store, and feed each other, and we were just really nice, and it was like...
David Nerattini
You have a lot of friends, right?
Mike Paradinas
Yeah. 
David Nerattini
But you had a lot of trouble. 
Mike Paradinas
Yeah, we had problems, we were all over the place, we had problems, we were always trying to do something, so we had to go to the shop, and we would go to the clubs, and we would go to the movies, and we would go to the clubs, and we would go to the clubs. We had so many friends, that we would call the club, and we would call the club. 
David Nerattini
Yeah. 
Mike Paradinas
To get out, we had to... I mean, we all had our own coach, and we would go to the shop, and we would sit in the shop, and we would take the milk, and we would take the bread, and we would take the bacon, and we would take the chips, and we would take the bacon and chips, and we would take the milk. And we would wash the dishes, and we would put our razors under the dish. And we would wait until the next day, and we would play all the songs, the new songs, and the old songs, and we would play them all. So I was always saying, “You can come in, but give me the milk, and give me the bread, and give me the bacon, and give me the chips.” And you know, I was never feeling too good, so we always had to be on the road. We always had to go to the shop, and we have to go to the club, and we have to go to the movies, and we have to go to the various different... You know, every time we came in, we would talk to the staff, and we would change our minds, and we would change our minds, and we would do it all. 
And we had to go out with some friends. We had to go out with some people, and we had to go out with some people, and we had to do it all. And we had to do it all with the band, because the band had so many friends. They would take us out, and we would stay at the hotel, and we would stay at this hotel, and we would stay at the hotel, and we would get very skinny, and we would eat and we would drink, and we would just go like that, and we would go out with a lot of friends. You know, and we had so many people to take care of us, and we had so many people to give us milk, and we had so many people to give us bread, and we had so many people to give us bacon, and we had so many people to give us chips. 
And we had so many... I was always telling my friends that if I had been a little bit better, I could have done it all. And I could have done it all, but I could not be a part of the band. I could not be a part of the band, because the band could never do any other thing than be the ultimate rock stars. And I was going through a lot, and I was always... I was always the biggest rock star that we ever had, and I was always a rock star, and I was always... I had so many people to take care of me, and I had so many people to do things with. And I had to go to the hospital, and I had to go to the doctors, and they always care about me, they always gave me ice, and they always gave me a lot of milk, and they always gave me the best cheese, and they always gave me the best bacon, and it always was all about... 
David Nerattini
Yeah, and you know, that’s a good thing, because you never know what you’re going to do, and you never know what you’re going to get out of it. 
Mike Paradinas
Yeah. I mean, one of the best things about being a woman, is, you can ever have a boyfriend, and you can ever have a boyfriend, if you want, and you can never have a boyfriend if you do not want. Because you are always searching for the next boyfriend, and you know, because you’ve been through so much
====================
When you have a group of friends that perform, you’re not really sure what to expect, it’s like you have this collection of musicians, you have this collection of different genres, it’s like a library and you can choose what to listen to. You can choose from music that’s or isn’t popular right now, and you can pick something from the past, you can choose from music that’s popular right now. You can choose from music that’s popular right now, or you can like something that’s popular right now. And you know what I say? You don’t do that. You listen to music and you decide what to listen to and what you like. And that is what is true, which is what many people do. I think that what’s so great about music is that you can have a different approach. People who have been around the music business for a long time, they can change gears and it works out in a way that you don’t think it would. 
Audience Member 
Hi. You’re listening to something that was popular in the ‘80s in some places, and people are just really confused, or maybe it is. “Oh, this is different from this, this is different.” 
Debbie Harry
Oh no, it’s not that. It’s like the same old record, there’s always something to be liked about it, like, “Oh, this is a different tune.” 
Audience Member
Whatever it is, it’s like a piece of music, but it’s not being played by a band, it’s being played by a DJ, or it’s being played by a group of people, it’s being played by a producer. It’s like, “Oh, ok.” 
Debbie Harry
A lot of people are going to think I’m saying this, but you know what I’m saying? You have to care about your music and you have to care about your audience. You have to be able to make an impact, and if you’re not in a position to make an impact, you’re going to be as good as you want to be. You’re going to be a success. You’re going to be a big winner, because it’s your music, but it’s not going to be your music, it’s not going to be you, it’s not going to be everybody else. It’s going to be you, and it’s going to be a big win for you, but you have to have your own vision, and if you don’t have your own vision, it’s going to be a bad thing. So you have to have your own vision, and if you’re not clear on what it is, it’s going to be somebody else’s vision, and that won’t be the end of it. 
Audience Member
Yeah. I mean, I think that’s great, but it’s also a big problem, because I think there’s a lot of people out there who have their own idea about what they want to do with their music and what they want to do with their music. I think people are getting confused because they don’t know what to expect, they don’t know what to expect from what they’re hearing. I think that’s a big problem with how we do music, is we get confused, because we listen to the same old music, and that’s not something that you want to listen to, but it’s a response, it’s a response to what’s happening in the world. I think that’s what’s really wonderful about music, that it’s able to respond to whatever you’re listening to, and I think that’s exactly what makes it special. That’s a great thing. 
Debbie Harry
Yeah. And I think that part of that is that, I think it’s great that people are making an impact, and that’s a big part of the reason why I’m so excited that I’m at the moment. 
Audience Member
Hi, I just wanted to say that the performance you did was amazing. You were just standing up on stage and you’re just doing something that people can’t really understand, but I think it was something that was pretty important to you at the time.

Joe Bataan, who was the producer for the album, was in New York in 1978 and he was in LA for a couple of years before he came home. He was very, very creative and he saw on the radio more and more of the Americans were feeling like it was becoming too much. They were trying to be creative and there was a lot of people in New York and Los Angeles that wanted to do hip-hop and they wanted to do it the same way. They wanted to be creative. Even the guys from DMC, they were young, they were not really getting that much success, but they were going at it and they had the opportunity to make it. That was the time when the hip-hop was really getting the right attitude and they were just getting it right, which was a good opportunity to be in the right place at the right time.
I remember when I came back in Chicago, it was too bad because I was the guitarist and they were just going at it and they had the opportunity to make it. If you look at Chicago records, as long as you don't have a chip, you can make a record. There was more music that was just going at it and it was just a lot of effort put into it, it was a lot of work, but they made it. I think Chicago, they got it right, but I think they had the opportunity to make it. It was good for Chicago music to be in the right place at the right time. It was good for Detroit.
Todd L. Burns 
Do you have a record that was your favorite on the album? 
Joe Bataan 
I have a record that I can say that was my favorite because I was in New York, but I couldn't go back there and break down the record, because I was in Chicago. I was 20, 21, and I was going through some personal stuff, but I felt like we were in a good place to be in because we didn't have that chip. I was in Chicago and I was going through some personal stuff, but I was in the right place at the right time because we were doing it all right, we were just doing it. I had all the right people in the right places at the right time.
Todd L. Burns 
What was the difference in the way you were approaching it as a production person versus a producer? 
Joe Bataan 
I was in the same place, but I was in New York. I was in LA at a time where there wasn't as much money or not as much money that was coming in. There was no radio. There was no TV. It was just all about the experience. It was just a learning process. There was just a lot of people that had the opportunity to be creative and it was just a learning process for me. I think that was the one thing that helped to become a successful producer. I think that was the time that I learned to be a good producer, I think that was the time that it was, I think I learned how to be creative and to be creative. I think that was the key. I was still young and at the time that was the time that I was in. I was in the right place at the right time.
Todd L. Burns 
That was the first record that you sat in the studio and you recorded at home? 
Joe Bataan 
That was the first record that I sat in the studio and recorded at home, because I didn't have an apartment in New York. I had a lot of money, but I didn't have an apartment. I didn't have a studio. I had a lot of things that I can say, but I wasn't in the right place at the right time. I was in Chicago and I was getting some personal stuff, but I didn't have the opportunity to be in the right place at the right time. I was kind of in the wrong place at the right time and I was going through some personal stuff and I was going through some personal stuff, but I didn't have the opportunity to be in the right place at the right time. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. That was an opportunity for me to learn how to be a good producer, it was a really good opportunity for me to be in the right place at the right time, I was in the right place at the right time.
Todd L. Burns 
Speaking of the right time, do you have it on your iPod or any of your devices? 
Joe Bataan 
No, I don't have it.
Todd L. Burns 
I don't have it on my iPod, but I have it on your iPod maybe. 
Joe Bataan 
Yeah, I can listen to it, but I don't have it on my iPod.
Todd L. Burns 
I have one for you.

Are you using a computer?
MARIO JANSON
No, we are using a computer.
TONY JONES
I am, yes, you have got a computer, but you are making music. And I think that, you know, that we’re not going to be able to do it the way we can if you want to do it the way we can. And I think that, as I said, that we’re not going to be able to do it. It’s all about the music, the technology, the technology is there. And I think that’s really what I’m talking about.
MARIO JANSON
No, I think we’re going to be able to do it, but that is the way you’re going to do it. I think we’re going to get away from it.
TONY JONES
Well, you were talking about electronic music, you were talking about electronic music culture, and there’s a lot of people out there that are doing it. So, what is it, what is it about electronic music that you like? What is it about electronic music that you’re excited about?
MARIO JANSON
It’s a lot of things, I mean. It is a lot of things. I think electronic music, if that makes any sense, electronic music, if you listen to the electronic music that you like, or if you’ve got a band out there that you love, or if you’ve got a record out there that you think is going to be interesting, electronic music, if it’s a good record, but if it’s not good, or if it’s not going to work, or if it’s not going to be good, it’s going to be interesting. I don’t know what it is that you have to do it, but I think you don’t have to do it. It’s interesting because it’s just a different genre. It’s not going to be the same as the electronic music that you’re used to, which is the electronic music that you know. It’s not going to be a dancehall record. It’s not going to be Electronic Music, it’s not going to be electronic music. It’s going to be a lot more technical than that.
TONY JONES
Everybody, I mean, if you’re going to be a success, it will be about you and the music you’re making. But I think, as you said before, it’s going to be interesting from a music point of view. I think the electronic music that you like, that’s going to be the one thing people will be excited about. I think electronic music is going to be more technical than that, but I think people will be excited about that.
MARIO JANSON
Yeah, I think that’s wise. I think that something like that will be exciting, because I think the kind of music that you do, that’s going to have a lot of people, they’re going to like it. Digital music, that’s coming along. I think that’s exciting, but I think it’s a new genre, I think it’s more about making records, and I think it’s going to be a lot more technical than what we have now. I think that’s a good thing. I think it’s interesting to have a new genre, but it’s not going to be the same as what we have now. As I said, I’m not going to be able to do it the way we can, but I think that’s good, I think that makes it exciting.
TONY JONES
Thank you, thanks.
MARIO JANSON
Yes.
TONY JONES
One of the things I think I’m interested in watching is how you see electronic music evolving.
MARIO JANSON
I think it’s going to evolve. I don’t think it’s going to be the same as what it is now. I think it’s going to be kind of different. I think the thing I’m interested in watching is how electronic music evolves. How do people play it, how people respond to it. I think that will be interesting to watch.
TONY JONES
How do you think of those people that are listening to electronic music at the moment, who are they? What are they listening to?
MARIO JANSON
Well, I think they are all listening to it. It’s not as big as it used to be. It
====================
We just start off, like I said, I'm in the forefront of making records for Gucci Mane and then there’s this new project from Gucci Mane called The Bird and the Snares, a project with Kendrick Lamar.
Hanna Bächer 
I think there’s a special moment when you start to make music that’s very unique, because I’m a musician and I want to make music that I love. I want to be able to listen to Kendrick Lamar, I want to listen to Big Daddy Kane, I want to listen to Kanye West, I want to listen to a lot of music from now. I feel like I was born into this culture, I’m from here, I’m from Miami and I’m from the South. I want to have the best music. I want to be able to listen to this music. I want to have the best music, I want to be able to get out there and play it to people. I want to be able to feel good, I want to feel comfortable. I want to feel good. I want to be able to be myself. I want to be able to do that. I want to be able to feel good.
Audience member 
I understand.
Hanna Bächer 
And I’m not trying to be like Kanye West or be like Big Daddy Kane, but I’m trying to be like myself. I’m trying to be like myself. I’m trying to be like myself with my music. I want to be able to do it. I want to be able to do it in a way that feels good to me. I want to be able to have a good time. I want to have good music when I play it. I want to be able to be like, “You know what? I wanna get on this album.” I want to have a great time. I want to be able to feel good. I want to be able to feel good. I want to feel good. I want my music to be good. When I play my music, I like to hear it with my eyes closed and my body in the arms of the person who’s coming in. I want to be able to feel good. I want to feel good. I want to feel good. I’m not trying to be like other artists doing things like that, but I’m trying to make music that my mom is like, “This is my son,” my brother, my little sister, my husband, my friends, and my family, they’re all in it together. I want to be able to be able to do that, because I’ve got a lot of people that are out there doing really great stuff. I want to be able to do that.
Audience member
Can I ask you something about Priest? I mean, you were talking about Priest, [John's] first album was really great. I mean, Priest is a pretty famous rapper. What was it like to have this album come out?
Hanna Bächer 
It was really amazing, man. I was like, “Man, it’s the first album ever.” I was like, “Wow, you know what? I’m gonna make an album.” I was like, “Wow, man. I’m not gonna make an album.” Then I did my first album, which is a special album of mine, because I was like a big fan of Priest. Priest’s not only a rapper, he’s a musician as well. He’s a great artist. He’s a great rapper. He’s a great producer too, man. He’s a great lyricist too. I can’t remember which album it was but it was really great. I’m really, really proud of it.
John Butler 
It was a lot of fun. The record was like the first album that he had done. Most of the people that were there at my house, they were like, “Yo, that was dope.” I was like, “Yo, that was dope.” I was probably like five, six years old, so I was like, “Man, you’re really very young.” Priest was very, very young. He was pretty much like a baby, but he still had a lot of energy. He was very passionate and he was like a baby, but he had a lot of energy. He had a lot of passion and he was a good kid. He was good to work with and he was good to me. I was in a good place, man.
Hanna Bächer 
Working with him was dope. Working with

“I want to do something special for you.”
I wanted to do something special for you,
because I think the Beatles were one of the most important in the history of music.
We’ve got to get the credits right, because I was at the time,
you know, Billy Joel, Bob Dylan, all of these people. I think they’re the
most important to terms of music.
Torsten Schmidt 
What do you think about the Beatles, in terms of the music industry?
Steve Arrington 
I think that they should be regarded as a very important time in music history, because they
were the first band to put out a record, and they were the first band to do a record
on their own label, and it was a very important time in music history. They were
the first band to put out a record, and I think they had a lot of influence on
me, because in my perspective they’re the most important band ever. They’ve
been on the cover of Time magazine. They were doing one of the greatest things ever.
Torsten Schmidt 
How did you get into music?
Steve Arrington 
I was born in New York, and I was a big fan of music, in my family was a musician,
and my older brother was a drummer. My first band was called the Prodigy, and I
was a drummer, and it was a punk band called the Arcade Fire and Arcade Fire. It was a great time, and I was
looking back, and I was seeing how much better it was going to get, and I was like, “I’m gonna
have to do something about it,” and do something. I wanted to do something special for people,
because I think the Beatles were one of the most important bands ever, and I couldn’t be
like any band that was doing something that wasn’t special. I wanted to do something special for people. I was
looking at it like, “What can I do for you?” I was like, “I’m looking for something special.” I was looking
at it in that way, and I wanted to do something special for people, but it was about the
excitement, you know, the excitement, the feeling, the excitement, and that was the
thing that I wanted to do.
Torsten Schmidt 
How did you get into music, a lot of heavy metal fans would say?
Steve Arrington 
I played in bands, I was a heavy metal fan, I was in a metal band called the Riot Marines,
and I was in a band called the Warheads, and I was in an early punk band called the Dandy
Raid, which was a huge punk rock act, and they were on MTV, which had MTV
kids, and they would have MTV Kids, and they had a lot of music videos, and it was actually the first time I ever
got to do a video, and I think that was in the video for “Good Times,” which
is like a house party video, and I think that was a big influence on me.
Torsten Schmidt 
Did you ever have a band or a label or whatever?
Steve Arrington 
Yeah, I went to a music store, and that was my first music store, and I was selling records
on the weekend, and I was doing music shows, and I was a big fan of bands like Genesis,
New Order, and the Prodigy. I was going to parties, I was going to clubs, I was
doing music, and I was seeing bands like Genesis and Bob Dylan, and I was hearing
the Clash, and I was hearing the Black Crowes, and I was hearing all of that. I was
listening to all of that, and that was the first time I ever heard music, as far as the
record was concerned, through the record store. I was just a kid, and I was a big fan
of music, and I was a big fan of the Revolution, the Black Panthers, the Panthers.
I was listening to all of that, and I was going to clubs, and I was going to parties. I was
getting into it, and I was thinking, “I’m going to do this,” and I was doing it, and
I was going to do it, and I was tired of doing it, and I was just getting into
it. I wasn’t thinking about making a record, I was just thinking about
making a record, and I was thinking, “I’m gonna do this,” and I was going to do it.
It was just a sort of impulse that I had, and I was just getting into it
