from the top down, as if they were in the running to be the first to do this. And so I was working on a tape for MCA and they were doing their own stuff, but I was working on a tape for MCA. It was just a matter of them wanting to do it right, but they wanted to do it right and there was no pressure to do it right.
Todd L. Burns 
A lot of people, when you’re working with an MCA producer, it’s like, “Hey, we have the money, we’ve made it, we’ve done it, we’ve got the contract, we’ve got the song, we’ve got the endorsement.” After you’re out of the record business, when you put the money and the time and the effort into it, it’s just fun, but it’s also a business. And so, when you’re in the business, you need to ask yourself, “Can I do it right?”
A lot of times when you work with an MCA producer, you’re just like, “You know what? Let them finish it.” It’s just like, “I know what you’re going to do.” “Let them finish it.” Then, when you’re out of the business, it’s like, “Well, what does it mean to you, really?” And so, I think people started to get interested and they wanted to do it right.
Todd L. Burns 
What did you think when the deal was done?
A lot of people have been talking about the fact that you signed a contract, but it was all really, really, really informal. What were you thinking when you signed that contract?
Todd L. Burns 
Well, since I was a little kid, I’ve always been a big fan of music. And I’ve always loved music and I’ve always loved music, but I’ve always had a problem with contracts and with signing contracts. Because it’s not really like it’s a good deal. It’s not a good deal to be under contract with a record company and a record company will take your record money and you’ll never hear anything of your own music again. It’s like, “OK, you got a record deal, whatever.”
And so, I always thought of it as a business. And I always wanted to do it right. I always wanted to make sure the record companies were getting to do their own thing. And so I always tried to do my best for them and I always wanted to do the best for them, but they wouldn’t do the best for me. I wanted to do the best for them, but I wanted to do the best for them.
I think it’s just, “I want the best for them, but I want the best for myself.” But I feel like I got to do the best for myself. I don’t want to be in the record business and be a record company manager. I want to be somebody in the record business that works for me, whether it’s a record company, whether it’s a label, whether it’s a record label. I want to make sure that I get the best deal for myself and my family, but I don’t want to be the record company manager and make sure that I can’t get a better deal.
So, I always wanted to do my best for them. And I always wanted to do the best for them. I just don’t want to be in the business to be a record company manager, I want to be the record company manager for my family, because I know what it means to you, but I also know what it means to me. And so, I’m like, “OK, that’s it.”
Now that I’ve been in the business for seven years, I know what it means to people and I know what it means to me. I’m not into it all, I’m not into this. I think that I’ve done something good for people in my family, but I know that it’s not good for you if you’re working for a record company. You know what I mean? I always wanted to do it right. And so when I got to the point where I had to do this record, it was like, “OK.” There’s so much that I want to do with this record. I love it. I love everything that I am doing. I love everything
====================
Late last year, the music group Dua Lipa released a track called “It’s My Time.” It was the first single released by Dua Lipa, and the track was released on the label and on iTunes and all of that stuff. 
So, it was like, “Oh, you know, it was just like a release, why don’t we do this one?” So I watched this video that I had on YouTube, and I just thought, “Oh, I love this one, why don’t we do one?” 
So, the Dua Lipa record came out online, and it was like, “Oh, this is the one.” So we did the track, and I did it with a lot of heavy basslines, but it was just a very honest, soulful record. So, I just did it. I did the album, and I do that twice. I do it three times. So, it was the same record, but I did it completely different, and I did it in a way that it was like an album that I didn’t even have to do an album like the first album, it was just a four-track tape or something. 
Geologist 
So, it was basically your first album, and then you would release a second album as well? 
Dua Lipa 
Yeah, I always did it four times. I have a lot of records with lots of samples from this album, and I don’t have to do the album, it’s just a three-track record. I’m just grateful that I have so many records that I have, and I can release them all. In the case of this record, I just got back from Brazil, and I just did it as a single. 
Geologist 
Do you have an album coming out, and what are you going to do with it? 
Dua Lipa 
I’m still in the process of releasing an album, until I feel like I have something to show people, but I will do my first album as a whole, and then I will do my second album as a whole. I’m still working on it. I want to do it in a way that I finish it. If I feel like I can do something with it, that’s cool, if I don’t feel like I can do something with it, I will release the album as one whole album. I promise you, when I release the album, I will have two tracks, and I want to show you two tracks. But, you know, the album as a whole, it’s more like I mixed it together, because I am just getting it ready to go on. 
Geologist 
So how did you get your name? 
Dua Lipa 
What happened was I was invited to be on the album by my friend, and I was like, “Wow, this is cool, this is cool, this is cool.” 
(music: Dua Lipa – “It’s My Time” / applause) 
Geologist 
So, do you want to share something with us? 
Dua Lipa 
Hey, I don’t have much to say. I just want to thank everyone for their love. 
Geologist 
Thank you. 
Dua Lipa 
I want to thank everyone that donated to the cause, because that’s what helped me get the music out there, and I hope that we can be a part of it. 
Geologist 
We’ve reached out to the producer for you. 
Dua Lipa 
Yeah, I’ve got a producer here. 
Geologist 
And then we’ll see. 
Dua Lipa 
Yeah, that’s it. 
Geologist
So, can you give us a tour of the studio? 
Dua Lipa 
Yeah, I’m gonna show you guys the studio and show you some of the things that I did there. 
Geologist 
Is there any more things you could show us? 
Dua Lipa 
Yeah, go ahead and let me show you. 
(music: Dua Lipa – “It’s My Time” / applause) 
Dua Lipa 
I guess that is all for today, and I hope that we can see you guys soon. 
Geologist 
I’m so happy that you have Dua Lipa. Thank you so much. 
Dua Lipa 
Thank you. 
Geologist 
Thank you. 

====================
“I” or “I”? 
The first one, of course, is “I.” I was very young, in the group of people that I have now, who have songs that are very popular and pop, in one form or another, in the world. In the music industry, I think in Korea, I think in the United States, there are a lot of people, like many of you here, who are very popular in this country, and I think that they are very important to get to know. 
They are very important because it’s very difficult to get to know somebody that you don’t know. That’s the most important thing. If you don’t know somebody, it’s not worth it. You go to that person and ask them questions, and if they’re cool, you go to the next person. If they’re not, you go back to the first person and ask them questions. 
I think that’s also important to know, that everybody has their own little label, and they have their own music and they get to know their artists and their music and everything. I think this great country and Korea is also very important to the world, because these countries have a lot of music. Everybody's got a different music, everybody’s got music, everybody’s got a different style of music. It’s very important to know what to listen for, what is popular and what is not popular there. I think that’s important. It’s important to know what kind of music to buy, what is popular in Korea. 
I think that’s another reason to be in Korea. There’s so much to do in Korea. You get to know your friends, you get to know probably your family, you get to know your co-workers, you get to know everyone. It’s really good to be in Korea, because this country is very good to work for, because it’s really good to know your people. 
There’s also some very good arguments for going to Korea. The food, the culture, the culture, the people, the culture, they’re really good. They’re really good. I know that I’m here because I’m from Korea. I know if I could work here, I could really do well. It’s about the people. If I was in India, I’d be very happy. I’m happy to work for the people. I’m happy to work for my country. I’m happy to work for my family. If I was in a country like Jamaica, I would be happy. 
I think it’s good to be from somewhere, because it’s important to know your roots. If you’re lucky, you can still have a good life. If you’re too lucky, you’ll be a dead person. Just work for your own happiness. I’m doing well in Korea, and I’m happy. People here, they are happy. I really love this country, and there’s so much to do. 
Torsten Schmidt 
The other question, there’s a lot of people here who are doing well, and it’s interesting because I’ve seen a lot of people, like in the States, you have a lot of people who are very successful or extremely good in their own country. It’s interesting at the same time, because you have a lot of people from the United States, but their success doesn’t really show up in the one place where they’re doing well, which is Korea. 
There’s a lot of people who are successful in one country, but they’re not doing well in another country, and I see a lot of people here who are going to be very proud. I think here in Korea, there are people who I’m very proud of, and I love Korea. I want to work for my country, and I want to work for my family. I want to work for my friends, and I want to work for my country. I want to stay happy and happy, and I want to be positive. I want to be happy and hopeful because I’m looking to be happy. 
Torsten Schmidt 
I think that it’s amazing that you are here, and what you are doing, that you’re making a lot of money and getting to do it in a very good way. What are you thinking about when you’re making this record? 
Joelle 
I think that when you’re making a record for yourself, you’re thinking, “What
====================
“It” is an old song, it’s just a track, it’s not really of the moment. But it’s good, it’s like a good song, and it’s a cover. By the way, we’re going to do a tribute to this song. And I’ll play “It” on the piano.

The Academy Award for Best Picture is a unique award. I think I’ll just mention it because we have a few. I think of all the movies that have won the Oscar, we have, obviously, a number of winners that we have, and I think that Oscar deserves to be awarded to the filmmakers that have put their blood and sweat into making the movie. That’s it. We have, obviously, a number of winners. There’s a number of winners that are very, very, very deserving. We just want to make sure that all of our filmmakers are given the chance to win.
I know that there have been a lot of critics of me and my stage show in the past, that I’ve gotten into trouble for, for having the stage show in Griffith Park. We have one or two other folks that I have been in trouble with, I have a lot of white people in the audience. They will say, “He had the best sound, did he?” “He had the best sound, did he?” I don’t have to say that. I don’t have to say that. I’ll say, “He had the best sound, did he?” “He did,” “Oh, f--- him, f--- him, f--- him, f--- him, f--- him, f--- him, f--- him, he’s got the best sound,” “Oh f--- him, f--- him, f--- him.” and then I have that, “I did, I did.” That is the kind of thing I say.
Todd L. Burns 
I want to see an example of a movie that you’ve won this year and you’re not in the lead role in it.
Robert Redford 
[applause]
Todd L. Burns 
I think we’ve got an example, we’ve got a movie that you’ve won the Academy Award for Best Picture, which is a sort of an Academy Award for the movie.
(music: Redford - “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”)
It’s a movie I’ve seen five times. I think we’ll see it tomorrow.
[laughter]
Robert Redford 
That is a movie of yours.
Todd L. Burns 
Let’s see if we can see it.
Robert Redford 
[laughter]
Todd L. Burns 
I’ll be right back.
[audience shouts]
Todd L. Burns 
You know what? I think we’re going to have one of the best things that you’ve ever done. You’ve won the Best Picture Oscar, you earned the Academy Award for Best Actor. This is a movie you’ve done three times. You’ve won the Academy Award for Best Picture, you got the Academy Award for Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress, you got the Grammy Award for Best Original Song. For a movie that’s been around for five years, you’ve done it three times.
Robert Redford 
I don’t know, I don’t know, I’ll have to check that out. I’ve never seen this movie. I think it’s probably the biggest movie ever made. It’s the biggest that I’ll ever seen, it’s a movie that will live on as long as people are watching it. I think that’s true. I don’t know about you, but I think that’s true. It’s something that has a lot of people at home, it’s a movie that is not going to be missed. It’s a movie that is going to be talked about forever. I think it’s going to be talked about for a long time. It’s a movie that people will be talking about. It’s a movie that people are going to see in movies, be talking about, it’s going to be talked about for a long time.
Todd L. Burns 
We’ve waited a long time for a movie to be nominated for Best Picture, so it’s a great honor.
Robert Redford 
I wouldn’t think that. It’s a very, very good movie. If you see it first, it’s like a very special movie. I’m going to play it for you. Oh, I hope you’re all going to get that. I hope you’re all going to get that.

====================
[Punch] would have had us on the street. I’m serious. I think he asked us to do this show. He’s a big black guy, he wanted us to do this show.
I’m from Boston, I don’t know about you, but I was born in Boston, but I was born in New York, and I was the only black kid in my high school in the whole state. I got into high school in a neighborhood in Boston called the West End. It was the only black school that had an integrated high school. I was probably the only black kid in that whole area. I was the only black kid on my block. I remember going to see the first Fight Night, which is when my high school got closed for a year. When we went to the police station that was my first time. I remember seeing the police in their car, and I was like, “What are the cops here for?” “They’re white people.” I was like, “You don’t know what you’re talking about.” 
It was like a black-only high school, and I remember sitting in the police station and being like, “What are you doing?” “Do you think we’ll use your school?” I’m like, “What do you think we’ll use your school?” “They’re black, they don’t know what you’re talking about, they’re white, they don’t know what we’re talking about, why would you want to use a school that has black kids in it?” 
As a kid, when you see a police car pull up in your neighborhood, you always think that someone is trying to kill you. It’s not like I was the first person to be killed in a car, but I remember seeing them pull up. I mean, they had no reason to do this, but they did. I was always the bad boy. You know what I mean? I was always the bad boy, but I thought we could always get out of it. I always was the bad boy. 
I was like, “You got a lot of trouble with these people, they know I’m going to fight them. I’m going to fight them until they give up.” I was always the bad boy, but I always was the good kid. I always was. I always played good sports, I always played smart. And I always was good with my mouth. I never got into any trouble, but I always had the right attitude. I always was like, “I don’t care what my mother says, I ain’t going to be fired, I ain’t going to get a shot at the NFL ‘cause that’s me.” 
It didn’t matter what they said. Whatever they said, we just kept it real and we just kept it serious. That was that. We didn’t care what they said. It was that simple. I don’t know if you remember, but we would go to a bank. We would go to a bank and be like, “What’s this?” We would tell them we was from Boston, and they would say, “You know what? This is Boston, this is Boston, and you don’t know what you’re talking about.” 
My mother was like, “The way you was, you had to be at a school that had black kids.” My dad was like, “No, we don’t want to be here.” My mom was like, “I don’t want to be here in the first place.” I was like, “You got to come to a school that has black kids.” My cousin was like, “You got to go to the school that has black kids.” I wasn’t into it, but I knew that’s what we wanted to do. 
I was the best student, but it wasn’t like I was the best sports player. I’m not going to lie. I was never the best athlete, but I could just put my body on the line. I was always the good kid. I never got in trouble, but I could just show up and do my thing. I would always be the good kid, but I could always be the bad kid. I never got in trouble, but I was always the good kid. I always was. 
I never got in trouble, but I always was the best student. It wasn’t like I was the best athlete,

Blacksmith
Hello, I’m very interested in your music. I think you’ve been making music for years. You’ve done a lot with different projects over the years and years and years. I think you’re one of the most prolific musicians of the American music industry. I think you’ve done a lot with different projects, like your first album, ¡La Roca”, which was released on The Roots, which was really important for me, for a lot of people, because I think it was really instrumental in getting me to where I am now. I think you’ve done a lot.
Julian Brimmers
Yeah, I’ve done a lot. I’ve done a lot. I’ve done a lot in my life. My father is a doctor, and he was a physician in a very small hospital in the Bronx. He didn’t have enough money to go to the doctor, but he was a very good doctor and he worked for a long time. He was a very successful doctor, and he had a lot of diabetes and he had a lot of health problems, and his family survived, but he was never so sick as he was in his 40s, and he had all these problems. His health was so bad, that he could never get back up. The doctors would never tell him what to do. He was always very healthy, and he never had a problem with his diet or anything.
Daft Punk 
I just want to say, I love your music. I think it’s really important to everyone that we put something on the internet that’s real, that’s genuine. I think it’s wonderful that you’re in this situation, because the world would never be the same without it. I think the way that you’re dealing with it now, I think that it’s really good that you’re doing this and you’re doing it. It’s a gift that you’ve given to the world. I think that’s really important. The way that you’re dealing with it is fantastic, and I think that it’s amazing to see that it’s working.
Julian Brimmers
Thanks for your kind words, Daft.
Daft Punk 
Thank you.
Julian Brimmers
I just know that you’re not gonna stop making music.
Daft Punk 
Nah, I’ll keep doing it. I’ll keep making music, and I’ll just keep making music. I want to say thank you for the kind words, Julian. You’ve made me appreciate that much more. I’m very grateful.
Julian Brimmers
I’m very grateful to you.
Daft Punk 
Yeah, thank you.
Julian Brimmers
Thank you for listening. 
Daft Punk 
Thank you.
Julian Brimmers 
We’ll be back next month, and we’ll do some more questions. 
Audience Member 
What did you think when you first heard the [Black] Panthers record?
Daft Punk 
I thought that it was the first hip-hop record, which is a compliment.
Audience Member 
I think it’s very important that you have something to listen to if you’re making music. I think that is something that you can’t put your finger on. You can listen to music, and you think that it’s good and you can say, “Oh, that’s great,” but like I said, there’s nothing to put your finger on, it’s just what you hear and what you think. I think that is what keeps you going. I think that’s what keeps you making music, is that you want to find something that’s familiar, because that’s what keeps you making music, is that you want to know that you can’t put your finger on, that you can’t put your finger on, that you know that you can’t put your finger on. That’s what keeps you going. If you can’t put your finger on, it’s not going to work. 
Julian Brimmers 
Thank you, Daft.

So, first of all, the only reason I stopped doing it was because I was in a relationship with someone on the production side of things, we were both in bands... I had a girlfriend on the record side. I was in a relationship with someone, but I was in a relationship with someone who was also the producer. That was my reason to stop. I’ve worked with people who are amazing and I’ve worked with people who are not amazing and I’m still working with people who are not amazing.
This is the thing, I was in a relationship with someone who was also the producer and I was in a relationship with someone who was not the producer. I was in a relationship. It’s a weird thing because you have to be in a relationship with someone you just get to know, and then one day you’re in a relationship with someone you’re not. That’s the thing. I worked with Chris Cornell, and I worked with Chris Cornell and I worked with a lot of people, so I worked with people like Chris Cornell, which is he was the producer, and I had a girlfriend. I was like, “I’m not going to go back to the studio so I’m going to be a producer.” I kept working with him and I’m still working with him, and we had a lot of problems with each other. I think Chris Cornell was the worst artist I ever worked with. He was being totally overbearing and I was like, “What the fuck?” I was working with Chris Cornell, and I was working with Chris Cornell. I had a girlfriend, and I was working with Chris Cornell. I was working with Chris Cornell. I mean, Chris Cornell was the producer, and I was working with Chris Cornell. I was working with Chris Cornell. I was working with Chris Cornell. I was working with Chris Cornell. I was working with Chris Cornell, and I was working with Chris Cornell. I was working with Chris Cornell, and I was working with Chris Cornell. 
I worked with Chris Cornell. We played a lot and we worked our asses off, and we were lucky because I had a lot of friends that I worked with. I had great friends working with me on projects, and I was lucky because I had a lot of friends working with me on projects. I worked with amazing people from all over the world. I worked with a lot of different people, but I don’t think I ever worked with anybody in my life that I didn’t work with. I’m just saying, I was lucky to have all of the great artists that I worked with.
Lauren Martin
Do you think this kind of... We’re talking about a lot of different tracks, but this is something that everyone has and it’s also something that a lot of people have. It’s not just a one track, it’s going to be a whole album. Do you think the audience is there to hear that? 
Alva Noto
I think that was the question. I think that was the question.
Lauren Martin
You said you worked with Chris Cornell and that was your first experience working with someone. Do you think that was a good experience to have?
Alva Noto
I never worked with anyone. I worked with Chris Cornell, and I worked with Chris Cornell. I worked with Chris Cornell, and I worked with Chris Cornell. I never worked with anybody. I never worked with anyone. I never worked with anyone. I never worked with anybody, and I never worked with anybody.

I think it was “We Don” by Emmett Brown. I think it was “She Needs to Know,” by Emmett Brown, “Moody” by Emmett Brown, “I Don’t Want To Go Home by Emmett Brown.

====================
In the early years of electronic music, it was always the fact that you could make records that would sound good, but you wouldn’t have any problems. You could do it, but you wouldn’t be recognized as an artist. It was always something about it, and it wasn’t easy to get noticed.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So, if you did, you had a lot of problems with your label?
MARK KORS
It wasn’t easy to get noticed, because you didn’t have a really big following. If you did a record, you’d have to play it to a very, very small audience, and so on. 
If you did a CD you could get to a big audience, they could get to the big, big, big record and no one would care. But if you did an album, you had to play it to a lot of people. So, you had to work a lot of tricks to get noticed. But it was always your music, your name and your name would be on all the records.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
The real reason for that was that you had to be a good artist, and you had to be good at what you did. 
And then, by the way, this was before the internet, and you had to get a lot of people to listen to your music, and you had to do it for them. You had to play it to a lot of people, and you had to be good at it. 
So, the real reason for that was that, if you did a good record, people would know who you were, and they would buy your records. But if you had a good record, people would listen to it and they would buy your records. And if they didn’t buy your records, then you had to be a little embarrassed and try to get back to the track and try to get your name and your name on it again.
MARK KORS
I don’t know about the internet, but the good thing about the internet is that, at least in the west coast, you could not tell me to have a good record. That’s the reason, a lot of people wanted a good record. I mean, I don’t know how many people know of me, but I love to play music, and I have great friends, and I have great friends who are musicians. I have great friends who are musicians, and so on. But I don’t know what to do with this. 
When I was young, I didn’t know what to do. I was like a nine-year-old kid, and I didn’t know what to do. I was like, “Yeah, I want to play this record,” and I would play it to my friends, and they would play it to me, and then I would go and do another record. 
But their record wasn’t good. I think I would have been a major success. It was the last record that I ever did, and that was in a record called “Time To Say Goodbye”. I was so disappointed in that record, because I was so excited about it, but at the same time, I was very, very frustrated because it was so fresh in my mind, and I didn’t know what to do with it. I had so many records that were so good, and I thought, “Oh my god, this was a big record, this was a big record,” and I wanted to be a lot more serious about it. So, I was always in the studio, and there was a lot of ideas in there, and I was having my own ideas, but I didn’t know what to do with them. 
I remember when I was in my early ‘20s, I was in my own studio, and I was playing in my own studio. It was like a tiny little studio, but at the same time, I was making records for myself. I was recording myself, and I was making records for myself, so it was really fun. 
But at the same time, I was making records for my friends, and I was making records for people who were listening to my music, and they would listen to them for their own records, and then I would be able to share my music with them. But I didn’t know what to do with it. 
So, I did my own label, and then I started doing recordings for other people. Then, I started doing recordings for other people, and I started doing records for people who were listening to my music. So, it was really fun, and I wanted to do it for myself, and I wanted to share my music. 
But at the same time, I
====================
We were saying that we were going to do a radio show when we came out of the studio. You can’t do that in the studio. You got to do it in a club. We came out of the studio and I was sitting there and I had a mic. I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.” I said, “This is something we can do.
Laurie Anderson
You’re talking about a club?
Hanna Bächer
A club, yeah.
Laurie Anderson
You’re doing a radio show for a club?
Hanna Bächer
Yeah, I’m doing a radio show for a club, a club called Club Philips. I’m doing a radio show for a club called Club Philips, who’s protesting against the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. I’m doing a radio show for a club called Club Philips, who’s protesting against the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. I’m doing a radio show for Club Philips, who’s protesting against the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia. I’m doing a radio show for Club Philips, who’s protesting against the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia.
Laurie Anderson
So that’s the club you were involved in?
Hanna Bächer
Yeah, that was the club that we used to play at.
Laurie Anderson
And how long have you been working with Radio Exodus for?
Hanna Bächer
About 16 years.
Laurie Anderson
And you’ve worked with them since then?
Hanna Bächer
That’s right.
Laurie Anderson
And a lot of DJs on Radio Exodus, like Jack White and Bev started, they were the first DJs to play with the band.
Hanna Bächer
They started playing with us after Radio Exodus came out. They’re already in a club, and the first thing that we’re going to see is Jack White and Bev playing in the club, and they’re doing a lot of party music. I don’t know if you remember Radio Exodus, but they were the first DJs to play with us. We had this club called Club Philips, and they played a lot of Latin, and we had more.
Laurie Anderson
But they’re not from Prague.
Hanna Bächer
They’re from Hamburg, and we had a club called Club Philips, we had about 60 DJs from up to 15 years. The first DJ they play for us was Jack White, and he was playing a lot of Latin and heavy house. He was playing a lot of Latin, and he was playing a lot of heavy house. We had this club called Club Philips, which was this kind of club where all the DJs played. We had a lot of DJs play, and it was a club where the DJs played for us. They played very heavy house and very heavy Latin songs.
Laurie Anderson
The whole time you’re in Club Philips, it feels like a very specific kind of music.
Hanna Bächer
Yeah, it’s very specific, and it was very, very specific, and very popular. The first time I saw Jack White, and he was playing very heavy Latin, and he was playing really heavy Latin.
Laurie Anderson
And you’re also into the American soul scene, right?
Hanna Bächer
Yeah, I’m into the American soul scene.
Laurie Anderson
And you have your own album, too, right?
Hanna Bächer
Yeah, I have my own album.
Laurie Anderson
And it’s called “Drain The Swamp”?
Hanna Bächer
Yeah, it’s called “Drain The Swamp”
Laurie Anderson
What did you do at Club Philips, and what was your role
====================
My understanding is that the DJ is the first one to pass the records. The producer is my second. I think that’s what makes it so special, to have a producer with a DJ side and a producer with a DJ side.
Todd L. Burns 
So is it the DJ that really gets your attention?
Audience Member 
I think the DJ is the first one to pass the records. I think the producer is the second one to pass the records. I think the DJ is the first one to pass the records.
Todd L. Burns 
You’ve spoken before about learning how to mix, how did you learn how to mix in the first place?
Audience Member 
I didn’t really. I grew up in the west suburbs, on the border of Chicago and then south suburbs. When I moved to the west suburbs, I did a lot of house parties. It was like, “Hey, I’m from the west suburbs.” [laughs] And I would go to the club and I would do house parties, and I would sometimes bring the DJ there, because I was a house party guy. And I would listen to music like Disco D’n’ Roll and the rest of the house parties. And there were people that were making house music, like Coki, who was a house producer and he was from South Side Chicago, and he was a house producer. And he would play house music. And I would listen to house music. And I would just go to a club and to get into my house parties, and I would listen to house music. And then I would go to a club and I would start to listen to house music. And then I would go back to Chicago and I would listen to house music, and then I would go home and I would hear house music again. And then I would go to my house party. And I would add house to my house parties. And then I would go back to Chicago and I would do house parties again, and then I would do house parties again, and then I would do house parties again. And I would listen to the house music again. And then I would go to the club for the second time, and then I would go to the house party. And then I would do house parties again. And then I would go home and I would listen to house music again. And then I would go to my house party again. And then I would go to the club again.
Todd L. Burns 
So did you know any house DJs?
Audience Member 
No.
Todd L. Burns 
So do you know any house DJs right now?
Audience Member 
No.
Todd L. Burns 
Well, you’re not getting any house DJs right now. I mean, there’s some great house DJs, but you can’t get any house DJs.
Audience Member 
Well, what about people like Coki who is from the west suburbs?
Todd L. Burns 
Coki is from the west suburbs.
Audience Member 
Coki? Oh, yeah, Coki.
Todd L. Burns 
Can you tell us a little bit about the house party?
Audience Member 
I mean, the house party was around ’77, ’78. And it would be at Club Down, and it was so we made house music, but it was really a house party, and it was a house party, and the house was loud, and the house was good, and it was fun. And you could do your own parties. And you could do your own parties. And the house was always loud, and everybody was dancing, and you could do your own house parties. And then we had a big house of clubs, because we had a bigger house of clubs.
Todd L. Burns 
So it was around this time that you started your house music label?
Audience Member 
I think in Chicago, the house was so loud, and it was crazy. It was crazy, and you could do your own parties, and that was the house.
Todd L. Burns 
You started your house label so that you could do your own house parties?
Audience Member 
Yes.
Todd L. Burns 
So you started your house label at the same time as you started your label, which you started at, right, right?
Audience Member 
Yes.
Todd L. Burns 
So was there a time when you were creating house music that you were working with a house producer, or do you think of yourself as a house producer?
Audience Member 
Yeah.
Todd L. Burns 
And was it something that you wanted to actually do, or you just wanted to do house music, or were you just looking to do house music?
====================
I have been in a relationship with an amazing woman, a woman who is always pushing me on. She is my every friend, my every woman in this room. I hope that maybe even if you all know who she is, if you think about who she is and where she is coming from, if you think about who she is, if you think about where she is coming from and that kind of stuff, that’s your answer. I didn’t think about that. I always had a good friend and a good woman. I’m so grateful for that. Thank you.

====================
When you first started out, were you really inspired by the whole techno scene? What was it about the whole scene that you wanted to follow?
Gareth Jones
I didn't want to follow the scene of the big techno labels. I wanted to be a remixer, I wanted to be a DJ. I wanted to be a DJ, I wanted to be a producer. I wanted to be a producer, I wanted to be a DJ and if I can be a DJ, I want to be a DJ. I wanted to be a DJ, I wanted to be a DJ and I wanted to be a producer.
Regardless of what label you are on or whatever, if you can be a DJ, be a DJ and be a producer, then that means you are a DJ and you are also a producer. That is all you can be. I want to be a DJ and I want to be a producer, and if I can be a DJ, then I want to be a producer and a DJ.
They don't really matter what label you are on, it doesn't really matter what they put – it doesn't really matter what label. If you are a DJ and a producer, then you can be anything you want to be, or you can be whatever you want to be. If you are a DJ, then you can be a producer, and if you are a producer, then you can be whatever you want to be.
When you are a DJ and a producer, and you want to be a DJ, then you can also be a DJ. I don't want to be a DJ and a producer, I want to be a DJ and a producer, and if I can be a DJ, then I want to be a DJ and a producer.
When I first started out, it was all about the DJ stuff, and I was into that. I started out DJing, and then I started DJing again, but I was into that. I was into all the clubs, I was into the clubs, I was into the whole club scene, I was into everything. I was very into the Roxy. There was always lots of clubs in New York, bars I had listened to. The Roxy was a place I was into, and then I went to live music. I was into the clubs, and then I moved to Pro Tools, and then I moved to GarageBand, and then I moved to Logic, and then I went to Ableton, and then I moved to Ableton Live.
When I was DJing, I was playing Roxy and Ableton Live. When I was DJing, I was playing GarageBand and Ableton Live. I was playing GarageBand, and I was playing Logic, and I was playing Pro Tools, and so on and so forth. When I was DJing, I was playing GarageBand and Ableton Live. I was playing GarageBand. I was playing Logic, and I was playing GarageBand Live. I was playing GarageBand Live.
When I was DJing, I was playing GarageBand and Ableton Live. When I was DJing, I was playing GarageBand and Ableton Live. I was playing GarageBand, and I was playing Logic, and I was playing Pro Tools, and so on and so forth.
Todd L. Burns
So, did you always wanted to be a producer or did you always want to be a DJ?
Gareth Jones
I didn't want to be a DJ, I just wanted to be a DJ. When I moved to there, I was already into all the clubs, and I was playing club music, and I was playing GarageBand. But I was also playing all kinds of music, and I was into club music. I was into club music, and just playing garage music, and I was a good DJ. I was a good DJ, and that was it. I just wanted to be a DJ and a producer. After being DJing, I was playing Ableton Live, and I was playing GarageBand, and I was going to parties. I was just a DJ, and that was it. From there, I just wanted to become a producer.
Todd L. Burns
You have a lot of people in the club now that have moved beyond club music.
Gareth Jones
There are a lot of producers, like I said, there are a lot of DJs in the club. There are a lot of DJs in the club, and you can go to clubs like the Club Med, which has all of my records, and just play GarageBand and Ableton Live, and they will play your record.
Todd L. Burns
And, actually, you have an upcoming show with Plastic People and you know, I have a lot of people in the crowd, so I would like to have your open for questions. What are you going to do?
Gareth Jones
I have a show tonight in New York, and I can show you some of

This is an image from a documentary that we did. But we never released it because we thought it was too graphic. But this is the graphic version of what this was like.
There was a lot of children in this studio because they were mostly in the school system. And they had to go through a lot of training because they were afraid to see their parents. And when they did that school they saw their own fathers, and they would only see their fathers in the book. And that was their only contact with their fathers. And therefore, they were afraid to see their fathers. And they would only see their fathers in the book. And their fathers never worked. And in the end, they would only see their fathers in the book. And in the end, it would be a big mistake to have a child in a room with their mother and father. And the mother and always the father would only see them in the book. And they would only see their fathers in the book. And they would only see their fathers in the book when they were about to die. And they would return to their mother and they would only see her in the book. And she would only see them in the book when they were about to die. So, a lot of children had to go through extensive training to do that.
But to be honest, as you can see, there was not enough jobs for them, and there was not enough money for them to live on. So, the system that they had to go through before they got jobs was that the mothers would only see their fathers in the book. And so, they would only see their fathers when they were about to die. And that was their only contact with their fathers. And the mother would only see their fathers in the book. And she would only see them in the book when they were about to die or when they went to the hospital. And that was their only contact. And that was the only contact that they had. And that was the only contact that they had. And that was their only contact. And that was their only contact, and that was the only contact they had. And that was the only contact that they had. And that was the only contact that they had. And that was their only contact. And that was their only contact. And as you can see, the mother always came first and the father was always second. And that was the only contact they had. And that was their only contact. And that was their only contact. And that was their only contact. And they never saw their fathers in the book. So, that is the only contact they had.
And that is how it worked. And they never saw their fathers in the book. And that was it. And that was their only contact. And that is the only way that I know, by myself, to find out if I was the right person for them. Because I was the only one that had access to their fathers, and I was the only one that had access to their fathers. And when I would move in with them, it was really just because they were the only people who could actually see their fathers. And they never saw their fathers in the book. And they never saw their fathers in the book. And they never saw their fathers in the book. And that was the kind of thing that I did. And that is how, when I did it, I did it.
And when I did it, I never saw my father in the book. And I never saw my mother or my father in the book. And I never saw my brothers or sisters in the book. And I never saw my other brothers or sisters. And I never saw my parents. And I never saw my parents during the movie. And I never saw my father in the book. And I never saw my mother or my father in the book. And I never saw my brothers or my sisters in the book. And I never saw my parents at the movie. And I never even saw them during the movie. And I never saw my mother or my father. And I never saw my brothers or my sisters during the movie. And I never saw my mother or my father at the movie. And I never saw my other brothers or my sisters at the movie. And I never saw my brothers or my sisters during the movie. And I never saw my other brothers or my sisters at the movie. And I never saw my mother or my father during the movie. And I never saw my other brothers or my sisters at the movie. And I never saw my mother or my father during the movie.

The '80s were a time of great music, great music being good music, and that meant that people were buying records, and buying records was good entertainment. But the music industry had no money to pay for the music. And we thought, “Well, they’ll just go to the radio in the clubs and you’ll be able to get the same record and you’ll have a better deal,” and that’s how it started, so we thought, “Well, we’ll see what happens.”
But, obviously, as the years went by, we learned more and more that this wasn’t the case. The record industry knew that the artists wanted the record, they wanted the record, if they did, it would be commercialized, the record industry wanted to put it on their album, and they would get free marketing. And so they would put it out, and it wouldn’t be anybody’s fault if a record was never released. But they would put it out, and the record industry would put it out, and the people that were buying the records would have to pay them, because there was no money for them. So the record industry, they knew that, “Hey, you want it on the album, you got to pay.” And so, they started to be more aggressive, and they started to think that they could get away with it. And so, this is what happened.
Every time I have a question, I wonder, “How am I going to get my question answered?” I get asked all the time. I just don’t know which question that is. But I always try to be as honest as possible, and I try to be as open as possible to people. And I try to listen to all kinds of music. I try to listen to everything. I try to listen to everything that I can get. I try to listen to everything that I can. Sometimes it’s a good thing to listen to more than one thing at a time. Because I have to make sure that I’m listening to things that people want to hear. Most of the time, it’s best to listen to one thing at a time, because that’s how it works.
Todd L. Burns 
To some degree, what did you think about the lyrics of “Shake It Out” and “Yes I Can”, and the way they were sung? Was it really that difficult to write them? Did you really think about it at all?
Hanna Bächer 
I think it was difficult to write them. I don’t know, I’ve worked with people who’ve been in a similar situation. And I think it was difficult to write them because you could’ve gone for the most traditional kind of writing, and you could’ve... I actually started writing the lyrics for “Shake It Out” on the piano, and I had an electric piano. But I didn’t think that it would be popular at all, so I didn’t want to think about it too much. And so, I started to write the lyrics. And I think it’s really good to be in a situation where you can choose your own direction. Because sometimes you don’t want to be in a situation where you’re just the same thing as everybody else. I think that’s where I’m at now. I’m a lot more comfortable writing lyrics now. I don’t want to be in a situation where I don’t want to be the same thing as everybody else. I don’t want to be like, “You know what? I’m as good as I ever will be,” because when you’re in the situation you’re in, you need to be... I have so much respect for anybody that’s in the situation. But if you feel that you can do it, then I’m going to be happy to help you. So, I think that’s how it works, you just have to choose your own direction. And I’m doing that.

Obviously, there is a lot of people out there still listening to these songs, or at least the ones you’ve worked with, and there is a lot of artists out there in the studio who are also sampling a lot of the work that you’ve done. But the fact that you spoke of you being a rookie, and being so young to be in this situation, and you’ve been through it before, how do you think about being in this situation with your own music?
Hanna Bächer 
I think that’s really important

Audience Member 
I have a question. 
Audience Member 
I want to know what you think about your time working with the band, coming up to New York to work with the band, how do you feel about being on the road for so long? 
Audience Member 
I’m so happy. I’m gonna ask you this question. I want to know what do you think of your success and what do you think of the success of your music? You know, I’m just, I’m so happy that you guys did so well. I want to know if you would ever do it again? 
Audience Member 
I don’t know. I mean, I don’t even know if I would ever do it again. I don’t know if I would ever do it back. I want to know, do you think you’ve got any more questions, or do you have any more questions?

Audience Member 
I was born and raised in New York, and I don’t know, my mom is from the Bronx, which is just a small town, but she’s a very big fan of the band. When I was born, she was a very active, big-time fan of the band, and she’s a very, very, very big-time fan of the band, and she was a very, very influential, big-time fan. I’m about to say this. She was very, very important in my life, and she’s a very, very important person, and she was a very, very, very big-time fan of the band, and I’m fortunate to be around her. 
Audience Member 
Hey. I’m just curious, if you’re ever going to do a concert, do you think you’ll be on the road for a long time? 
Audience Member 
Yeah. I mean, I’m sad that I don’t have answers, and I think I’m happy that I don’t have questions. I’m glad that I don’t have any questions. I’m glad that I don’t have any questions. I’m glad that I don’t have any questions. 
Audience Member 
I’ll ask you, can you answer my question? I took my time with the band, and I just want to know if you know who Roberta Flack
====================
What do you think?
Aaron Gonsher
I think that the thing that I would bring to it is that I think I’m a musician, but I never thought I would be as successful as I am. I thought I would be as successful as I am. But I’m not happy with what I have, I’ve been blessed and that has to do with the fact that I’m a musician, I have a lot of cultural impact to do with it. But I think I’m also a good person because there might be days when you’re not able to do something, and I get to do my thing and get to do my thing, and that’s what I’m going to continue to do. And I’m going to continue to make music and I’m going to continue to cause as much dissention and as much controversy. And I think that that’s the way it is for people in general, it’s the way it is for other artists, it’s the way it is for people who are making music, it’s the way it is for musicians, it’s the way it is for artists, it’s the way it is for musicians, it’s the way it is for musicians. And I think that is the way it is for people that are making music. It’s not going to change, I’m not going to change, it’s not going to disappear. There’s always going to be a commercialism in it. There’s always going to be a commercialism in music, and there’s still going to be a commercialism with music. And that’s the nature of it, and that’s the way it is for people to make money, to make money from some people’s ideas and from other people’s ideas, and to make money from how creative people are. And I think that that’s what will continue to happen. That’s what I’m going to continue to do.
Audience member
Hi, thank you.
Aaron Gonsher
You’re welcome.
Audience member
I really like your music. I really like your music.
For a little bit of context, you said that you came up in Japan. Are you from?
Aaron Gonsher
I mean, I’m from New York, but I’m not from New York. I’m from New York, but I’m from Japan. I’m from New York, but I’m not from New York. I’m from Japan, I’m from New York, but I’m not from New York. It’s just that’s how I got my name. I’m a very American, very white American musician. I’m from New York, but I’m not from New York. I’m from New York, but I’m not from New York. It’s just that’s how I got my name. When I was a kid, and when I was a kid, I always didn’t think I would be here, but I’m glad that I’m here, because I’ve been blessed to be here. If I could just explain to you, I’m from New York. 
[applause]
Aaron Gonsher
I’m from New York. I’m from New York.
Audience member
I was wondering, when you were making this record, was it like the beat was also your idea or was it someone else’s idea?
Aaron Gonsher
I don’t know. I was just thinking about it. It was like working with someone else’s ideas and just trying to do something that you think is going to be good, and trying to do something. I think that’s what I’ve been doing, I’ve been working with people’s ideas, and I think that’s what people want to hear. Even if it’s not the best idea, that’s what they want to hear. That’s what I’ve been working with, I’ve been working with people’s ideas, and I’ve been working with people’s ideas. It hasn’t really been a conscious decision, it’s just been happening. I think that’s what I’ve been working with.

====================
This was a time of joy in London, for the women of the Royal Family. Now we have to explain that it was a time of joy in Paris.
(music: Queen – “The Bitter Taste of London” / applause)
Colm Meaney     
I think one of the most important things is “Don't Let Me Be Alone,” the song “Don't Let Me Be Alone.”
It was a song that was recorded over a year ago and then you can hear it now. I think it’s important to remember that, yes, there were moments of fear and panic, but there were also things that were positive, like the following.
The BBC: I mean, we were not going to be allowed to be out in the rain; that was not allowed.
The Radio Times: Have it good, Mother Earth.
Colm Meaney    
So it’s a very optimistic song, it’s very optimistic, and we have to say that. 
Benji B    
Because, you become like a bit of a hero, you become this beacon of light, and the world knows that you are okay, and we’d like to have you back.
Colm Meaney    
We are going to have some real world fun, you want to play something?
Benji B    
There’s some things I like, and I’m going to go to the bathroom.
(music: Queen – “Don” / applause)
Colm Meaney    
That’s the song.
Benji B    
I mean, it’s a very positive song, but it’s also very humanistic.
Colm Meaney    
It’s very humanistic, and it’s a very good song. 
Benji B    
What did you learn from that experience, that you did the album and you were in the studio?
Colm Meaney    
Well, we knew we were in this space, and we were able to do an album that was very emotional. We don’t want to be uninteresting, it’s like we’re going to do this thing and do a show and do a concert. 
Benji B    
I’m sure that there’s a lot of people who would like to do a concert, but do you think you’ve ever been in a concert situation?
Colm Meaney    
We have. We have a lot of friends in the audience. But we spent so much time in the studio. We had so much music, we had so much music, we had so much time to listen to music, and it was a time of joy in London. We are, we have a lot of friends in the audience, and they are here for us, and they are like: “I love you,” or whatever you say. But I know that all of us are going to be here for this album and for this show. We are going to be here for the children, and we are going to be here for the people. 
Benji B    
Since you have such a strong presence, do you feel that somehow in the last year, or the last few years, that you’ve made a statement or a mark?
Colm Meaney    
No, no. I feel like I meant nothing, and I mean, you’ve done nothing, you didn’t have any impact on the industry, you didn’t have any money, so the thing that I needed to say was you need to do something, you don’t have to do it in England, you don’t have to do it in America, you don’t have to do it in Australia, you don’t have to do it anywhere but you have to do it in London, you have to do it in Paris, you have to do it in Berlin, you have to do it in New York, you have to do it in Tokyo, you have to do it in Asia, you have to do it in Africa, because then it is going to be known. And then you have to go to Europe, and then you have to go to America. And then you have to go to Australia, and then you have to go to South Africa, because then people will understand that you’ve done something, and it will be known. 
Benji B   
You’ve done something, you’ve done a lot of music, you’ve done a lot of projects in London
