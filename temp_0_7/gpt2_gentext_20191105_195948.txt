"The party was a big hit at the time, but then the next thing the promoter says, “OK, well, we’ll do another party.” So I said, “What if we have another party with a bigger audience?” And the promoter said, “Well, I’ll do it.” And he did so. And the next time I went to the club, it was 2014 and I said, “So how do you do it?” So I said, “Well, I do it myself, but I make the video with the DJ and I do the music myself.” I’ve done it for years and years and years, and I’ve seen it become very popular. And the next thing you know, I’m in a video with the DJ, and I hear it, “OK, let’s go.” The promoter said, “Oh, that’s it.” So it was really like a big hit at the time. But then I did a video for the club, I did a video for the DJ, and then my manager said, “OK, you go, and if you’re going to do it, let’s do it,” and I did it.
I started to think, “OK, so there’s no harm if I do it, but how do I make it like a regular club?” I made the video with the DJ, and I did it for years. And I decided to take the club and put up the DJ, but at the same time I started to think about the club and the DJ, and to be honest, I was really coming from a music background that I’d never really had, and what I have now is a DJ who’s a professional, and I don’t know what to tell you. I’ve heard a lot of DJs, and I’ve heard some DJs that are really good. I’ve heard some DJs that are really bad. But I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I want to be a DJ, but I feel really good about what I do. I don’t want to be a music journalist, but I don’t want to be a DJ to be honest. But the moment I saw some of these DJs, I was like, “Damn, this is a video, this is music, this is a club, this is my life.” It’s like, “Damn!” I was looking at these guys, and I was like, “OK, there’s no harm, I’m going to do it.” And then when the DJ goes, “OK, you got a video, I’ve got a DJ.” And then I made the video and the DJ goes, “OK, let’s go.”
And he goes, “OK, let’s have another party.” And he was like, “OK, let’s do it.” And I was like, “OK, if you do it, I’m happy, OK.”
And then I did another video for the club, with the DJ and the DJ’s music, and I made the video for the club. And the DJ was actually in the video, and I did the music myself, and then I had a club called the Stairway to Heaven, and I did the video for the club, and another video for the Stairway to Heaven. And then I did another video for the club, with the DJ and the DJ’s music, and I made the video for the club, and I did the video for the DJ. And then I did another video for the club, and then I did another video for the DJ. And then I did another video for the club, and then I did another video for the DJ. And then I did another video for the club, and then I did another video for the DJ. And then I did another video for the DJ, and then I did another video for the DJ. And that was my last video for the club, and in ’86, I think it was, I do another club for the DJ, and I do another club for the DJ. And in ’86, ’83, ’84, ’85, I do another club for the DJ. And I did the video for the DJ, and I do another video for the DJ. And then I do another video for the club, and then I do another video for the DJ. And then I do another video for the DJ in the club, and then I do the video for the DJ
====================
”I never even knew that” was the phrase that was going to be used, but then, if you think that the first moment of “I Never...” was the first time, it’s like, “Oh, now I’m going to be in the band,” or something... I think that’s the first time I heard that. I don’t know what it was, but I think that was the first time I heard “I Never...” and I was like, “Oh, OK, that’s cool.” 
Emma Warren
What was your first experience of… 
Robin Thicke
Oh, I had a really bad experience with the guy. I think the guy was a good-looking guy, but he was a bad-looking guy. I remember he had a big, big pussy, so he was always on the dance floor, and I was like, “Look at that,” and I was like, “What is this guy doing?” I don’t know, but the guy was a bitch, so he had this big big ass, and I had this little fucker but he was always on the dance floor. But the thing was that I remember that the guy had this big, big pussy, and all the girls had big tits, and I think that was the first time I heard the word “big” and I was like, “Wow, that’s cool.” 
Emma Warren
What was your first experience of someone singing “I Never....”? 
Robin Thicke
My first experience of someone singing “I Never...” was like a housewife, I was really into housewife, and I was in my apartment and I was watching TV and I was like, “This is cool,” and I was like, “What the fuck?” I was like, “Alright, this is cool.” 
Emma Warren
Do you wear pants? 
Robin Thicke
I don’t. I never wore pants. 
I don’t wear pants, I wore my French maid uniform, and the guy was always on the French maid station, the ladies were always on the French maid station, and this guy was like, “Yeah, that’s cool.” I wasn’t into wearing pants, but I think I looked cool in my French maid uniform. 
Emma Warren
I was thinking about the girl who did “I Never...” and you guys, I think you have to go back to that idea, with the way that you’re able to sing in that way, the way that you’re able to sing, and then you have the time, and you have the space that you have to make your music, and you can’t just be in one spot all the time, you have to be in a room that you can feel more comfortable in, and you can’t just go to the bathroom and you can’t just have a wig and a wig and a dress on, you have to be in a room that you can feel more comfortable in, so I didn’t want to go to the bathroom all the time, I wanted to be in a room that I could feel comfortable in. 
Robyn
You’ve said before that it’s a sound of a house, and that’s what I was listening to, and that’s what I was listening to. 
Robin Thicke
It’s a sound of the house. 
Robyn
That can be, “I never saw that coming,” or “You better feel me, I don’t like that,” but it’s a sound of the house. 
Robin Thicke
It’s not like a house, but it’s like a big house, and that was when I was in my French maid uniform. 
Emma Warren
So, you’re telling me that when you said that you were in your French maid uniform that you wanted to be in a room that you could feel more comfortable with, and that you wanted to have more space to be able to hear yourself and feel more comfortable? 
Robyn
That was like the first feeling I had, the feeling of being in my French maid uniform, was like I was in a room that I could feel comfortable in, but I didn’t want to be in a bathroom, I wanted to be in a room that I could feel comfortable in, and that was when I was in my French maid uniform. 
Emma Warren
But you’re not talking about the bathroom
====================
The next initiative, which I can show, is a project that I’ve been working on for a long time, with my partner for a long time, we have a project called I’ve Been In A Laundry for a long time. 
(music: Joe Bataan & Urban Homicide – “I’ve Been In A Laundry” / applause)
The project really has been about education, and we started with a program to help kids explain that they were victims of violence, and that they were not alone, and that it was OK to be a victim of violence. We started with a program for kids to explain that they were victims of violence, and were not alone, and that violence is not OK, and that violence is beautiful. We started with the television show, I have Been In A Laundry, and we started with the network about kids who were victims of violence, to help kids understand that they are not alone, and that violence is beautiful. 
(music: Joe Bataan & Urban Homicide – “I Have Been In A Laundry” / applause)
Davide Bortot 
You were talking about your relationship with music, and how it was in a way really a kind of education, to get to know each other, in a way. You were talking about how you’re two of the largest producers in the world, and it was also about helping kids understand that they could be an artist, and they could do what they wanted to do. How did you start to know each other, in the first place? 
Joe Bataan 
I started when I was about 13, and I was like, “I’m going to do something.” I was going to be an artist, and I was going to do something. I was going to be the producer, and I was going to be someone. I was going to be a rapper. I was going to do things, and I was going to be somebody. 
I didn’t know what stuff to do as a teenager, so I started doing it. I started doing things like, I’m going to do something when I get older. I was going to do something with my brothers, and I was going to do something with my friends. I was going to do something with my mom and my sister. I was going to do something with my friends, so I was like, “OK, I’m going to do something,” and I was going to do something with my friends, so I was going to do something, but I was not going to do just music, I was going to do something else, so I was going to do something else. 
I was going to do something with my brothers, and I was going to do something with my friends. I was going to do something with my parents. I’m going to do something with my brothers, and I was going to do something with my friends, so it was just, “OK, I’m going to do something.” I was going to do something with my family, and I was going to do something with my friends. I was going to do something with my brothers, and I was going to do something with my friends, so it was just, “OK, I’m going to do something,” and I was going to do something else. 
But the blueprint was still there, and it was just a matter of figuring out the right thing to do with it, and I was going to do something with my family, and I was going to do something with my friends, so it was just going to be a result of that. 
Davide Bortot 
You said that you were going to do something, but how many people did you meet along the way? 
Joe Bataan 
I met two people, and I’ve met three as well, through all of these people. When I was about 13, I met an older brother, through my brother, who was up in Long Island, and I was going to meet him before I was 13, and he was on Long Island, and he was going to meet me before I was 13. I met my twin sister, who was a teen mom, and she was going to meet me before I was 13, and she was going to meet me before I was 13. I met my baby brother, who was a young man, and he was going to meet me when I was 13, and my grandmother was going to meet me when I was 13. 
I met my boyfriend, who was going to meet me after I got to Long Island, and my boyfriend was going to meet me after I got to Long Island. We met more friends, and then we had a couple of friends that were going to
====================
Music fanatics are very confused now because of the success of the album. I mean, in the British press there’s a lot of talk about the success of the album and then there’s a lot of people in the general public that are saying, “Oh, wait a minute, that’s what people want to hear.”
So, the thing is, with a lot of new music coming out, people are going to listen to your records and they’re going to buy them anyway because they’re going to buy you a drink or a pizza or whatever. That does have an impact on your business. It’s like you want to do what people want to hear. 
Benji B 
Do you think that would have happened to your career if it wasn’t for the success of the album?
John Diess 
Yeah, definitely. If you’re a musician and you’re the best music journalist in the world, you’re going to get a lot of attention. If you’re a music entrepreneur, you know that you get some attention, you know that people want to know about you, they want to know who you are and they want to get into a club and they want to buy your records, right?
So, the thing is that, the thing that I think that people remember is that I kind of created the music scene in the UK, and I created the record industry, and I created the record industry in the UK. And it’s a very small country. It’s got some of the best music culture in the world. If you’re not in that kind of music culture, you’re never going to get the attention that you want. So, I think a lot of people forget that I created the scene and I created the record industry.
Benji B 
So, you’ve also worked for the likes of A Tribe Called Quest, Kanye West, and now some of the biggest names in music.
John Diess 
I got to do all of them, yeah. At the end of the day, they’re all big stars and they’re all an incredible example, and I’m proud to be a part of it. I’m not going to lie to you, I’m not going to lie to you. But I think it’s important that people know that I’m not the only one that did it. I mean, I’ve worked for the biggest names on the planet and I’ve worked for big stars. But we all have our own culture and our own culture and our own style and we all have our own, I think, and I don’t want to be just too generic. I don’t want to be just, “I work for them, they work for me,” but I’m going to deal with it. I’m not going to be the same as them, I’m not going to be as generic as them. I don’t want to be just, “Hey, you’re going to do this record,” because that can be a way of selling records. I’m not going to be like that, I’m not going to be a generic, “I work for them, I work for you,” type of person. I’m going to be different. I’m going to take my time and I’m going to be a really good, really honest, and proud record collector and I’m going to enjoy the experience of it. 
Benji B 
Is there a time when you’re not proud of your work?
John Diess 
I think a lot of people are. I don’t know if people are going to be interested in what I have to say about this, but I think there’s a lot of guys out there who don’t want to know the truth, and they want to know what I’m going to do next. I don’t want to be somebody that everyone is going to want to buy, I want to have a good time, I want to enjoy it, and then I want to be all the way there at the end. I’m not going to be like, “Oh, I should have done that, I should have done that,” or whatever you want to think, it’s just not going to work, and if it does, I’m going to do some of that. I’m going to be an honest person, I’m going to take my time and I’m going to be a really good record collector and I’m going to enjoy it
====================
He’s just one of those artists that’s always been in my memory. I think that’s something that sort of comes from buying vinyl because I think people just want to hear the music that they liked. I think many people have this idea of buying vinyl because you get to listen to something and you want to know what you like. You don’t want to buy something that’s just going to be a distraction. You want to know what you like. I think sometimes people don’t listen to music that they like, they’ll just buy something else. They’ll just play it and they’ll be like, “Oh, it’s this, it’s that.” I think that’s just a waste of money, but I think it’s just a waste of time, so you want to listen to music that you like and something special.
Todd L. Burns 
One of the things that I thought about when you were thinking about making this album was, like, what would be a good album cover? What would be a good look? What would be a good silhouette.
Sasha Fierce 
I wouldn’t say anything, but I would say: “Steep.”
Todd L. Burns 
Steep. What was it?
Sasha Fierce 
“Steep.”
Todd L. Burns 
“Steep,” that’s what you have to do.
Sasha Fierce 
It’s like, you can’t just put a picture on a flyer and say, “Hey, this is the guy we’re talking about.” I think you have to put a message on it. It’s like, “Hey, this guy is a huge star, he’s got some serious clout.”
Todd L. Burns 
I think you’ve had a lot of success in a short amount of time, but you’re also a bit of a pioneer in a way, as far as live music. Do you ever feel like you’re a pioneer?
Sasha Fierce 
I think I’m a pioneer because I’ve been around for a long time. I’ve been around for 20 years, but I’ve been in my house for 15 years. I think I’ve probably been in my house for 12 months, but I’ve been around for five years. I probably haven’t been in my house for 10 years.
Todd L. Burns 
That’s how many years?
Sasha Fierce 
Three.
Todd L. Burns 
[laughter]
Todd L. Burns 
What is the difference in ten years between that and writing the song you wrote, which is like, I mean, the keyboard player for the album, it’s not a song. It’s not like you’re in a jam band or something like that. It’s a really interesting thing when you’re in a house, you can’t do much with your time. You can’t sit in your room and write melodies, you can’t write songs, you can’t do anything. You’re living with the people you’re dating. You’re working with other people. You’re doing other things. It really can’t be a solo record. It’s just you as a musician. You’re taking some music that you’ve been listening to and you’re putting it on this album, maybe it’s different.
Sasha Fierce 
I think that what’s really special about making a solo record is that you can do it in a house. It’s like, I will never be able to do it on my own. I think that’s really special about making a solo record. You can do it in a house, you can do it on a bus, you can do it in a hotel. You can do it on a plane. You can do it in a hotel and you can do it on a bus. It’s really about the collaboration. I mean, you’ll always be able to find something that you can work with, but it’s really about the collaboration.
Todd L. Burns 
One of the things that I really like about your sound is you have this kind of, in a way, kind of unique sound. You’re not like, “Whoa, this is different.” You’re quite open-minded, you’re not like, “This is too much, there�

The polar vortex is a phenomenon caused by the northern hemisphere's two largest round-earth satellites, each of which is about twice the size of Earth. The Arctic is a region of the northern hemisphere, The Antarctic is a region of the southern hemisphere, and the Tropics are a region of the tropical system.
The polar vortex is a phenomenon caused by the northern hemisphere's two largest round-earth satellites, each of which is about twice the size of Earth. The Arctic is a region of the northern hemisphere, The Antarctic is a region of the southern hemisphere, and the Tropics are a region of the tropical system.
A polar vortex affects all continents. It is currently affecting the entire northern hemisphere, which is the northern hemisphere, and the eastern hemisphere, which is the southern hemisphere. The polar vortex affects everything, including North America. It affects the western hemisphere, which is the western hemisphere. It affects the eastern, which is the southern hemisphere. It affects the northern, which is the eastern hemisphere. It affects the western, which is the southern hemisphere. It affects the northern, which is the western hemisphere.
It affects everything. It affects us, but it affects the rest of the world. The polar vortex is a phenomenon, it affects other people as well. We are affected by it, but it also impacts even our own planet, because it causes hurricanes. A tornado, at the time, was caused by a storm. Hurricane Sandy, which hit the US, it was the worst storm ever. It is the worst storm ever. It is a cyclone, it is an ocean, it is a storm, it is what it is.
It has to do with the fact that the polar vortex has been caused by an event. The same storm, the same storm, has continued to occur. It was caused by a tropical cyclone, which is a storm. It was caused by the polar vortex, which is a tropical cyclone.
The storm that hit the US, Sandy, was the worst storm ever. It is the worst storm ever. It is the worst storm ever. It is the worst storm ever.
(applause)
We are talking about a storm that was caused by a tropical cyclone, not by a hurricane. It is a storm. It is a storm, it is a hurricane. We are talking about a storm that caused the collapse of the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, the Pentagon that had been struck by a plane that was shot down. That is a storm, it is a hurricane. I don't know what the exact numbers are, but it is a storm. It is a hurricane. It is a disaster. It is a disaster.
Todd L. Burns
Any more questions?
Audience member   
Hi, thank you. I just want to know, when you were growing up in Chicago, how did you feel about the fact that the area you grew up in was becoming a really big, big city, and then suddenly it became a very, very different place.
Bernard Purdie   
I was raised in New York, and I was in college. There was a lot of uplifting things about the city, and I didn't want to leave it, so I thought, “Well, I just want to go to college.” But I was able to do that, so I was able to go to Boston College. I was a student, I was active, I was in the student government, I was in the student government, I was active in the student body. I was a student at Harvard, I was a student at Yale, I was a student at Princeton.
I was in a dorm, I was in a fraternity, I was a student at Northwestern, I was a student at the University of Chicago. I was a very active, very active student, and I was a very good student. I was able to do that, so I consider myself a very good student. I am very good at school, and I am very good at work, so I consider myself a very good student.
Audience member   
Yeah, sure.
Bernard Purdie   
Yeah, sure.
Audience member   
Yeah.
Bernard Purdie    
I think I am very good at school, I am very good at work, and I am very good at study. I think I am very good at school, I am very good at work. I am very good at study and at studying, I am very good at school. I do know that I am good at school, because I think I was good at school. I think I was good at school, I think I was good at work, I think I was good at college.
Audience member    
Can I ask a question, please?
Bernard Purdie     
Sure, sure.
Audience
====================
’80s
[on the album] I was just like, “Yeah, man. I’m going to make some music right now.” I’m going to do some music right now.
I’m going to do some music, yeah. I’m going to do some music, but I’m going to do some music that will make people stand up and say, “Damn! I don’t think that’s going to be around, either.” And it’s not going to change, but it’s going to change. I’m going to do a record that I’m going to put out. I’m going to put the record out, but I’m going to do the album, and then I’m going to do the album.
You know, you got 20 years of music in your life, and then you’re like, “Damn! This record is not going to be around.” You know what I mean? It’s a different thing now where we’re moving forward. We’re not going backward. We’re going forward with that.
Audience Member 
You got the album over with.
Brian Eno 
Yeah, I’m making the album. I’m not a punk. I am not a hardcore punk. I’m playing music, like most of the people in this room are, I don’t know, you know, hip-hop, and I like music, and I like music, and I like music, and I like music, I just like music.
I always go back to the first album, and I remember that album. I think it’s really difficult to write music in front of people that you love. In front of people that you love, and I like that, but it’s very difficult to write music in front of people that you’re going to like. You know, it’s really hard to write music in front of people that you’re going to like. And maybe that’s what’s so interesting about music, is that when you write music, when you write music, it’s really easy to put out something with 12 tracks. And you can put out 12 tracks and it’s a record that people like, and then you can have an album out and people will like it. And it’s not like, “Oh no, I’m going to put out a record that’s going to be like this record, and this album is going to be like this album,” or whatever. You know what I mean? And I’m happy with that.
Audience Member
We’re talking about people that you love, and you know, it’s like you even did a record with the same name, if we can’t get that right.
Brian Eno 
Yeah.
Audience Member
No, but we’re talking about people that you’ve worked with, like, if we can’t put that right, but you’re making the music that you love, and that’s the thing, you know what I mean? I think that’s what people love, is that you can put out something that people like, and then you know what I mean? I think that’s what is really important. I think that’s what’s good about it, and I think it’s really nice to be in a situation where you can put out stuff and people love it. And most of the time you crack it, and then the people crack it, and then they hear about it. And then it’s like, “Damn, that was good.” And you know what I mean? That’s the thing.
Brian Eno 
I think that’s the reason why I’m at this point in my life. I’m not going to be doing this forever, but I’m confident enough that I can do it, because I’m still here. I’m still in it, I’m still there, I’m still inspired by it. I’m still here, I’m still doing it. This is my goal, this is what I’m going to do. I’m going to do it, I’m going to do it, and I’m going to do it. I’m not going to do it now, because I’m not going to stop. I’m going to do it, but it’s not going to change

This is a 3-minute clip from the first album of the great American composer Henry Mancuso, who composed the music for all of the first American films. The music is about as raw as it gets, and it’s called “The Jazz Age”
[from this video]<|endoftext|>What is a Boutique?
A Boutique is a group of people and it’s all about the music. You can make a record and sell it for $4,000 and you don’t have to worry about piracy and it’s not at all about the labels or the labels have no influence on you at all. You can do it, it’s just about selling beats. 
If you have a beat that you like and you’re in a band, but you’re producing, sell it for $1,000 and you can get all the money that it takes to make a record. If you’re a producer, sell it for $2,000 and you can get $5,000. If you make a record for $2,000 and you can get $3,000. If you’re a DJ, sell it for $2,000 and you can get $3,000. Anybody can do it. If you’re a DJ, sell it for $1,000. That’s just it. It’s all about the music, it’s not about selling beats. 
I’m just going to play one of my records that I made. I’m going to work with this guy, Jay Z from the Smackdown team, for example, or whoever you are, you can make a record for $1,000 and you can get $5,000. It’s all about the music. 
This is a song called “You Can Be My Love,” by Derrick Carter. You know what I mean? If you don’t like it, don’t buy it. 
(music: Derrick Carter - “You Can Be My Love (Dance Boutique Remix)” / applause)
That’s the first record I did for $1,000, and I don’t have to worry about the label or the labels have no influence on you. No one really cares about the labels, or the labels don’t have any influence on you because you can do it the way you want to do it just by the music. 
I think at the time, those are the days when you could have the biggest releases and the biggest sales, and if you’re a DJ, you should be a DJ. If you’re a producer, you should be a producer, you should be DJing. I think that’s what I think, and that’s what I’m going to do. 
Trevor Horn 
What was the name of the track on the album? 
DJ Premier
“You Can Be My Love.” 
DJ Premier 
It was called “You Can Be My Love,” right? 
Trevor Horn 
“You Can Be My Love.” 
DJ Premier 
It was $4,000. 
Trevor Horn 
That is a song, not even $5,000. 
DJ Premier 
Yeah. It was a beat. It was like “Sugar Pop,” or something like that, the beat was $2,000 to $3,000. I think that’s what I do every time, I’m doing it every time. I don’t think I’ve ever done it in the studio. It’s the same thing with pop music, it’s like, “Let me put it out on the radio and try to get it to be $1,000.” I don’t have to worry about it, I don’t have to worry about the labels or the labels have no influence over me. I can do it the way I want to do it, I can do it the way I want to do it, and I can do it the way I want to do it. 
I think that was the reason why “Sugar Pop” was so big, because it was that same beat. I’ve always liked the hook, but I’ve always liked the hook and I never really liked the record or the music. I’m going to do this record with Jay Z, I’m going to do this record with Chris Brown and the Furious Five, I’m going to do this record with Chris Brown and Big Daddy Kane, I’m going to do the same thing.
====================
Becoming the next Wolfsbane, the new generation of Pittsburgh heavy hitters, and the Los Angeles punk scene, the breakthrough of voices and remixes that were so good at that time, was the one thing that made it possible for them to become the next big break. 
So, “Wolfsbane” became a hit, “The Wolfsbane,” by a new wave group called the War. It was like a big hit in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York. It was the first time I was sold out in Pittsburgh, I was there and I heard it. 
The record happened to be in the Best Buy and I think I bought it for my girlfriend, and it was a big record. I saw it on a radio back in Pittsburgh, and I bought it from the same shop. It was the first time I heard “Love And A Dance” by Lady Gaga and “Candy Shop” by Chaka Khan. 
I remember thinking, “What the hell am I doing here?” I went on tour with my band and I thought, “OK, I’m able to do this,” but I wasn’t able to make it to the studio and I couldn’t make it to the studio with anybody. I was just there and there was no money, but I was able to make it to the studio and I was able to play the album. The record was released in my house, and I was really happy. I had my first album released by Goldie in my house, and I was able to do that. 
I was lucky because my dad was a record producer, and he had the same label as I do, and he had the same studio. So, when I was nine months old I went to the studio. I sat down. I listened to it and I said, “OK, I like this record, but I don’t know if I can make it.” He said, “No, no, no, no.” So, I was six months pregnant, I was in the womb, and he said, “Well, you have to do it.” So, I got pregnant and I got pregnant and I had my first baby. I had my second baby, and that was my first album. 
I was able to do it because I was actually producing records, because I was really listening to records, and I was not listening to electronic music. I was listening to jazz, and I was listening to soul, I was listening to everything. I was listening to everything. I had my own label, and I was able to do that. 
And I had my first album released by Goldie in my house, and my first record was released by Goldie in the house, and the record was sold out. 
I was really happy and I wasn’t really worried about making a record. I was just a musician and I was just happy and I was happy to have it done. I was happy to have it done. It was a 12-piece band and they had a lot of college kids in there, and they were just like, “Here, let me see this thing.” And I thought, “OK, I’m going to take your picture.” And they took my picture and I took theirs. 
And then the album came out, and it was released by Goldie. It was released by the same label, and that was my first album. I wasn’t thinking, “OK, I’m going to do this,” because I remember I had a very concerned mother, and I was a mother that had had problems with her and I remember she was always arguing with me and I was always complaining about her. 
I was a mother that was going to fight for her, and I was going to fight for her every time, because she’s always been working for me and I’ve always been working for her. 
I was a mother that was going to fight for her children, but I was also a mother that was going to work for the kids that were being used for this record. I was going to do that, and if I could do it, I wanted to do it. 
But I was just going to do it because I was a musician, I was a producer, and I wanted to be a musician. And I was just going to do it because I was a musician, and I wanted to be a producer. 
And I was going to do it because I was a musician, and I wanted to be a producer. 
And I was going to do it because I was a musician, and I wanted to be a producer. I wanted to do it because I wanted to be a producer. I wanted to be a musician. And I was

I think we have to remember this because not many people really understand this, but I don’t think that there’s really any reason for you to have a bicycle.
Werner Herzog
I’m dying to ride a bicycle, but I don’t think you should, it’s just very difficult. I’m not going to ride a bicycle, it’s just too expensive.
Music
I think that you have to understand, that is the exact reason why I still don’t ride a bicycle. There’s a lot of other stuff that happens in life. You have to remember that in youth, no one’s going to buy you a car. There’s no one going to buy you a house, for instance. People just won’t give you a car. There’s no one going to buy you a car. It’s just too expensive because you have to pay for it. In the end, you have to go to work and you have to pay your rent. If you have children, don’t live in a car, don’t rent a car. If you’re elderly, don’t get a car. Everything is going to break down, it’s a trade of what to do with your life and what to do with your money.
Abigail O
I think there’s no reason to have a car. The bicycle is not the best transportation system for you. My question is, why is the bicycle the best transportation system for you? I don’t understand. I’ve heard it’s because of the bicycle, the bicycle is very light. It’s really a very good bicycle. It’s not really like a car, it’s not a big SUV or anything like that. It’s just a bicycle. If you have a car, yes, you can ride it, but if you don’t have a car, it’s not going to be a long journey. If you can’t ride it, it’s going to be really difficult to get to your destination. I think we have to remember this too, is that. I think we have to remember, that’s why I think I’m so passionate about bicycles, is because when I was a kid, I saw bicycles everywhere. I was not going to get a car any more. So, when I was young, I saw bicycles everywhere. I don’t think you can imagine biking everywhere for a living, but I think I can imagine biking for a living.
When I was an adult, I think I have realized that if you can get a car, you can get a house. If you can’t afford a car, you can get a bike. I think that’s what’s important. If you can get a job, you can get a house, but you’ll have a bicycle. That’s why I think I’m passionate about bicycles because I felt like I could do something with my life. It was not going to be easy, and it was not going to be easy to get a car, but I felt like I could do something with my life.
Music
I think that it’s also important to remember that the bicycle is not the cheapest or the fastest bicycle. It’s a bicycle that’s not designed to go anywhere fast, but it’s a bicycle that can help you go somewhere, through the city, to the sea, to the mountains, and there’s no planning, it’s just a walk. I think that’s the thing, that’s the whole reason I love bicycles. It’s that simple. I’m not going to get a car like I used to. I’m not going to get a house like I used to. I don’t want to get a car, I don’t want to rent a house, I don’t want to buy a car. I don’t want to eat any more, I don’t want to drink any more, I don’t want to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. I don’t want to do it. I don’t want to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to do it. I’m not
====================
Let me explain something. A lot of people, they don’t know what to do with this. In the first few years, you had a lot of DJs on the radio that used to play records, you had radio stations that used to play old records, you had clubs that used to play old records. If you’re a DJ and you know somebody that knows a lot about that, you can look at them and say, “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” But if you’re a DJ, you can’t put a record and say, “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.”
You know, it’s a very different thing, really. “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.” “This guy is from Chicago, this is a beat maker.”
So, this is the whole thing, that you have to be in the right place at the right time. And the people that have the ability to get into the right place are the ones that have the right sound, the ones that have the right attitude, the people that have the right attitude, the people that are talented. And then, the people that have the ability to do it, the ones that are talented, they’re the ones that have the brains, the ones that have the brains, they’re the ones that have the talent, they’re the ones that have the contacts, the ones that have the contacts, then, they can get all these people that are doing what they have to do, they can get the people that have the ability to do it, they can get the people that are talented, they can get the people that have the contacts and they can get the people that are smart, they can get the people that are smart, they can get the people that have the contacts, they can get the people that have the contacts, and then, it’s the personal touch that makes it happen.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
Would you be interested in a career in music?
DESPITE an early career in radio in Chicago, you have a life of freedom. You can go anywhere, you can go anywhere you want, you can do anything you want, and you can go almost anywhere you want. You can sit down at a bar, you can sit down at the movies, you can do anything you want, and you can do anything you want.
You can go to the dancefloor, you can go to the clubs, you can go to the clubs and you can go to the clubs. You can go to the movies, you can go to the movies, you can go to the clubs. You can go to the clubs, you can go to the movies, you can go to the clubs, you can go to the clubs, you can go to the dancefloor, you can go to the clubs, and you can go to the movies.
That’s all it is. That’s what it is, that’s all it is.

Did you see any of your friends in the movie industry?
DESPITE a lifelong childhood, you have a life of freedom. You can go anywhere you want to. You can go to the movies, you can go to the movies, you can go to the clubs, you can go to the clubs, you can go to the
====================
So, let me play something from a very long time ago. I think it’s a very important one, and it’s played by a band called The Black Keys.
(music: Black Keys – “I Can” / applause)
I don’t know if you guys are familiar with this band, but it’s great. It’s not a format that you see on really big records now, but it’s good. It’s pretty important to me. The Black Keys, they’re not a band that I’ve gotten to know personally, but there’s lots of good music out there, and I’m happy to be a part of that.
Todd L. Burns 
When you talk to people about your career, as you alluded to earlier, you’re a pioneer of the whole of electronic music. Are there things that you’ll tell people about the history of electronic music, but that they’ll probably only know in a couple of years, or do you have to be like, “OK, this is a record from 2000 and this is one of the first records to make me think, “That could be a record?”
Angela Davis 
There’s a lot of history, and I’m not going to say that’s the whole history of electronic music. I never saw this record in a theater. I don’t even know if you guys have seen it, but it’s very important to me. It’s really important to me, and I’m definitely not trying to be like, “Man, I can’t be like this, man.” I just want people to say, “Wow, this is a great record.” It’s really important to me, to be able to say that. I don’t want to be like, “Oh, OK, this is a great record, but I can’t be like that.” I want to say, “This is a record that’s going to be on your radio in 20 years, or 25 years, or 30 years, you’re going to remember it, it’s going to be on your album, it’s going to be on your cassette, it’s going to be out on your CD, it’s going to be in your house, it’s going to be in your library.” I want people to say, “Wow, this is a great record.” I want people to say, “Wow, this is a great record, but maybe I don’t like it.” I want people to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Did you like it?” I think that’s really the key to it, to be able to say, “This is a great record, but do you like it?” I want people to be able to say, “I don’t like this record, but do you like it?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to be able to say, “Do you like this record?” I want people to

====================
It’s a real hoot, it’s got a lot of power, it’s got a lot of hype. Because it’s the first time that I really got to hear that kind of stuff. 
I felt like it was like maybe, the people that I was listening to had never heard anything like that. I think that’s what made it stand out.
Tony Dale 
I think that was the biggest thing that we heard, the first time we heard something like that. It didn’t have any words. It was just music. It was just music. There was no words. It was just an expression of love that I couldn’t help but love. It’s like the people that I was listening to, they were just like, “I don’t know how you feel about that.” It didn’t have no meaning. It was just a little word. It was just a word that people were just like, “I don’t know how you feel about this.” It didn’t have any meaning. It wasn’t a lot. It was just, “I don’t know how you feel about that.” It just had no power. It was just a little word that was just a little word. It was just a little term. It was just a little word. It wasn’t a lot. It was just a little expression that’s like, “I don’t know how you feel about that.” It just had no power. It was just a little word.
I don’t know, it just felt good. I guess, I’m a big believer in the power of words, in just being able to express what you want to express and just be able to express it. I don’t know what it means, but it just felt good. I think the first time I listened to “The Band”, I just thought, “Wow, crazy music.” I thought it was really electrifying. I thought it was very scary. I thought it was really interesting and powerful, because it was just a little thing. It wasn’t a song, it was just a little thing. It just was.
That’s when I started listening to “I Want You Back” and just listening to it, and I couldn’t stop. It just kept me interested in music, the way that it’s coming from a motherfucker’s perspective. I just thought, “Well, what do you think of this?” I’m not actually human. I don’t have a personality, I’m not a person. That was my first experience of listening to music in a way that was humanized. It was an experience that was completely humanized, because it wasn’t like anything else I had ever listened to before.
Todd L. Burns 
If you listen to pop music, there’s a number of tracks that you associate more with Joy Division, in terms of that. There’s a lot of tracks that have a lot of the same elements that you associate with Joy Division, that are quite different. It’s like, “Whoa, this is different.” You have “I Want You Back” by the Band, “I Want You Back” by Joy Division, “Band on the Run” by the Cure, “Green Light” by the Police, “Lucky Strike,” “A.R.E.” by the Rascals, “I Want You Back - I Want You Back” by AC/DC, “Love Me Like You
Want Me Back” by the Supremes, “Hey Jude” by the Eagles, “You’re in My Heart” by the Beach Boys, “Lucky Strike” by the Police, “I Want You Back” by AC/DC, “Love Me Like You Want Me Back” by the Beach Boys, “Green Light” by the Supertramp, “I Want You Back” by the Beach Boys. There was a lot of stuff that was just different. It’s just different.
Tony Dale 
There was an example of that, it was “I Want You Back” by the Band.
Tony Dale 
Yeah, exactly.
Tony Dale 
It was one of those tracks that we made on, the first time we’ve ever done a band. We had a lot of friends that were in bands. We had like a lot of people that were in bands. We had a whole lot of equipment.
====================
When I was working in the studio, I would do a lot of jazz records for people who were really into jazz. I did a record with Joe Strummer called “Jazz A-Sides,” but I would do it for my friends, who were into jazz. So, I wanted to make a record that they could be into. So, when I did a record for a jazzman who was into jazz, and it was a record that I had done for Chicago, and I started playing with them, and they started being into jazz. So, when I did a record for a jazzman, that was the first record that I had with the Chicago jazz scene. It was like a Chicago record, it was very important. It was the first record I had released with the Chicago jazz scene. And that was the first record that I released with a Chicago jazzman. 
I would do a record with a jazzman and ask them to join me in the studio. If you asked them to join me in the studio, you would know that they were into jazz. And if they would agree to join me in the studio, they would play every time, and I would work with them. I would work with them after the record. It was the first record that I had ever done that I had worked with someone who was into jazz. So, that was a big deal for me. And I could play everything. So, when I was working with them, everything, it was jazz. I would do a record with them. It was going to be a jazz part, I would do a record for them, and they would work with the jazz artist or the Chicago jazz artist. And then I would go to the studio, and I would do a record for them. And that was the first record that I would ever do with a Chicago jazz artist. And that was my first record with a Chicago jazzman. 
Todd L. Burns
Do you have any jazz records that you have produced? 
Curtis Mayfield
Not really. I don't like jazz albums, I don't like jazz records. I think if you like jazz records, you know, good records. But I don't like jazz records, I don't like jazz albums, I don't like jazz records. I think that record was about the Chicago jazz scene, because they were all about jazz. And that was the first record that I had done that had a Chicago jazz element in it. And I thought that was a good record. And I would do jazz albums with Chicago jazz artists. They were into jazz, so they would work with me. But they didn't work with me, they didn't work with the Chicago jazz artists. So, that was the first record I had done and that was my first record. 
Todd L. Burns
Mitch Albom was doing so well for yourself in the studio, you mentioned earlier that you worked with him at the time. 
Curtis Mayfield
Yes, he was doing so well, and the Chicago jazz scene was the scene for me. And I had worked with them on the record. And they were into jazz, and that was the first record I had done that had a Chicago jazz element to it. And that was the first record that I had done with a Chicago jazz artist, because they were all into jazz, and I had worked with them. And that was the first record I had ever done, that had a lot of Chicago jazz in it. And that was my first record I had worked with a Chicago jazz artist. And that was my first record with a Chicago jazz artist. She was an incredible singer, and she had a lot of great songs on there. And I would work with her, and I would work with Joe Strummer on this record. So, that was the first record I had done. 
Todd L. Burns
Now, you were working in Chicago, and you were working with folks at the time. How did you make it happen that the Chicago jazz scene was such a big part of your life? 
Curtis Mayfield
I was working at the time, and I was working on a record that had a lot of Chicago jazz in it. But I was working with Joe Strummer, and I was working with Joe Strummer and my brother, who was working with Joe Strummer, and it was like working in a studio with all these people, and they were all into jazz. And I was working with Joe Strummer, and I was working with Joe Strummer on this record. And it was a success for me, because I didn't have to worry about getting out of my first record, because it was all jazz. And it was all Chicago jazz. I had brought in young kids, and I brought out these people, and I was bringing them in to the recording studio, and it was a success for me, because it was the first record I had done that had
====================
He was in a group called The Rhythm Devils, he had a band called The Wonder Kids, and then there were other groups. 
John Coltrane, a guy called John Coltrane, which is a group that was really, really good. That was the early year. The Rhythm Devils, The Wonder Kids, and then there was a group called the Beach Boys. 
(music: Beach Boys – “I Want You Back” / applause)  
John Coltrane, “I Want You Back”, “I Wanna Know What You Want (Kraftwerk – “No Pressure Space” / applause) 
So it was just like that. 
Todd L. Burns
Do you think that probably has something to do with the fact that Bernie Taupin, who was the head of the Beach Boys and the Beach Boys, was a guest at the party? 
Gilles Peterson
I think that’s true, although I don’t know exactly what was going on in the ‘60s. 
Todd L. Burns
You don’t think that’s really relevant to the question of the Beach Boys? 
Gilles Peterson
No, I don’t think that’s relevant. 
Todd L. Burns
Maybe it’s just from the memory? 
Gilles Peterson
I don’t think so. 
Todd L. Burns
In fact, you were just talking to us a little bit about a couple of people, the two of you, who were from California and you moved to New York at a very young age. 
Gilles Peterson
Yeah. I moved to New York at a very young age. 
Todd L. Burns
Did you think of yourself as an urban kid? 
Gilles Peterson
I think I was. I was born in Detroit. 
Todd L. Burns
It was a tough city. 
Gilles Peterson
I mean, if you look at the city, if you look at Detroit, it’s a beautiful city, it’s a beautiful city. 
Todd L. Burns
What was it like to grow up in Detroit? 
Gilles Peterson
That was a tough city. When I was in school, that’s a very, very good question. I was very fortunate to have a lot of good teachers, but I was lucky to have good schools, because there were no kids in the school system that were poor, and that was a problem. 
Todd L. Burns
And there was also a lot of slavery in the city. 
Gilles Peterson
Yes, of course, in the city. 
Todd L. Burns
And do you think about it as a racist city? 
Gilles Peterson
Yes, that was an issue in Detroit. In the days when I was born, that was a big issue. 
Todd L. Burns
I mean, there’s these pictures of our friends. 
Gilles Peterson
Yes, that was a big issue. 
Todd L. Burns
Wouldn’t it be nice to have a picture to show us? 
Gilles Peterson
Oh, yes. 
Todd L. Burns
Your dad was a Marine. 
Gilles Peterson
Yes, sir. 
Todd L. Burns
Do you feel like people are starting to... 
Gilles Peterson
Of course, of course. 
Todd L. Burns
You’re going to look like this. 
Gilles Peterson
That’s what’s great about my ancestors, ’cause they knew what they’re about. 
Todd L. Burns
How was it to be a kid growing up in Detroit? 
Gilles Peterson
It was absolutely terrible. I remember my mom, my stepfather was a police officer, and he had trouble getting me out of jail. I would go to the police station once a year and my mom would come and I would shut her mouth. 
Todd L. Burns
I mean, you didn’t have a lot to go on, then, to be a kid growing up in Detroit, so how was it coming to being a teenager in Detroit? 
Gilles Peterson
It was a tough thing to grow up in. 
Todd L. Burns
And what would you say was your mother’s First Lady, if you can’t remember her name? 
Gilles Peterson
My mother was very religious, but she was very religious in her politics. 
Todd L. Burns
You mean being a mother, or a mother before you was a mother, or a mother before you, or something? 
Gilles Peterson
Yes, my mother was a mother of five from Detroit. She

====================
Yes, I know. This is an interesting one. There’s a guy that we were talking about, Tom Tom Club, that’s the guy that was in the game, that was on the cover of the Rolling Stones albums, that had a picture of him in a black suit. That’s my guy.
Kenneth Lobo 
I can’t really put too much into it, but when you do an album, it’s like going to a club with a black person, and you know they’re on the cover of Rolling Stones albums. You can get a great deal.
Allan Nicholls 
And when you put the photos, it’s not like you put the name of the record on the cover and the artist, the name of the album is on the cover. It’s like, “OK, let me put the photo of the record on the record.” It’s like a joke, it’s just a joke. I mean, you have a name on the record. You can put the name of the record, there’s a picture of the record, and it’s called “The Days of Youth” by Tom Tom Club, and it’s everybody’s favorite track, “You’re My Baby,” by Tom Tom Club.
Kenneth Lobo 
Yes, and the name of the record is Tom Tom Club. The record is called Tom Tom Club, “The Days of Youth”
Allan Nicholls 
And it’s a song that is very popular with kids, and it’s very popular. There’s a kid named Tom Tom Club, and he’s from Chicago, and he’s a Chicago kid. He’s a troubled youth. I think that’s why he does this record. He’s a teenage kid. He’s in the same neighborhood, he’s a troubled youth, and he’s in a funk band called The Roots. I mean, Tom Tom Club, the record is called Tom Tom Club, and it’s gonna be a hit, it’s gonna be a hit. And I think that’s why he did it.
Jack White 
Yeah, I mean, there’s a lot of kids, but it’s not a lot of kids, it’s a lot of people who’s coming to see me, it’s not a lot of people that remember me, and it’s a lot of people who’ll come and see the record, and they’ll come and see the record, and they’ll come and see the album.
Kenneth Lobo 
And the other thing you have to remember is that Tom Tom Club, that’s not like Tom Tom Club, you know, it’s very, very soulful, and very, very beautiful. And I think that’s why it’s very popular in Chicago, because it has that soulful, very soulful sound. And so you might have a record like, “Tom Tom Club,” Tom Tom Tom Club, Tom Tom Club, and it’s a hit record. It’s a hit record.
Allan Nicholls 
Yeah. So, this record is very popular in Chicago, and I have a record on the same label, Tom Tom Club, and it’s got the same name, and it’s a record that has played a lot for years in Chicago. And it’s called Tom Tom Club, Tom Tom Club, it’s a hit record, and I think that’s why it’s a hit record, because it’s the same record, the same musicians, but I think that the Chicago crowd is very receptive to that record, because that song is very popular in Chicago. I think that the Chicago crowd is very receptive to that record. It’s a hit record. 
Kenneth Lobo 
Yeah, it’s a hit record, and it’ll be a hit record. I think that’s the reason why it’s a hit record. It’s a hit record because it’s a hit record, and it’s going to be a hit record. It’s not going to be a hit record because it’s on another label, because we’re in Chicago, and it’s going to be hit record. It’s going to be a hit record because it’s a hit record. It’s going to be a hit record because it’s going to be a hit record, and it’

New Delhi: The Archdeacon of the Church of Scientology of India and the Church of Scientology of India, as well as the High Level Executive Committee of the Church of Scientology of India, have called for government to shut down the Haryana government.
In a letter to the Home Minister of the state, the Church of Scientology of India and the Church of Scientology of India said the government needs to shut down the entire Haryana state to prevent the growing influence of the Church of Scientology of India and the Church of Scientology of India.
"The government has already committed to shut down the whole of Haryana. It is totally unjust that the government is not listening to the Church of Scientology of India and is not listening to the Church of Scientology of India. It is totally unjust that the government is not understanding that the Church of Scientology of India is an organization which is a force to be reckoned with. It is totally unjust that the government is not listening to the Church of Scientology of India and is not listening to the Church of Scientology of India. Do not give up on your rights. If the government has closed down the entire country, will you still be there? We are ready to give up. We will not give up."
They also said that the government should not surrender to the Church of Scientology of India and not listen to them.
"We have been arguing with the Home Ministry for almost three years but the Home Ministry has not listened to our plea. The Home Ministry is giving money to the Church of Scientology of India. There is no reason why the government should not give the Church of Scientology of India money. The Church of Scientology of India is a force to be reckoned with. They have been giving money to the government, which is completely inappropriate. It is not right. If the government has closed down the entire country, will you still be there? We are ready to give up."
The Church of Scientology of India has also called for the government to make it mandatory for people to report the church for no other reason than to stop the influence of the Church of Scientology of India and the Church of Scientology of India.
"The government should not give any money to the Church of Scientology of India, which is a force to be reckoned with," Scientology of India said in the letter.
Sarita Narayanan, who is the President of the Church of Scientology of India, said in the letter, "The religious outfit is one of the best kept secret organisations in the world, and is a force to be reckoned with. The government should not give any money to the Church of Scientology of India or the religious outfit. The government should not give any money to the Church of Scientology of India. If the government has closed the entire country, will you still be there? We are ready to give up."
