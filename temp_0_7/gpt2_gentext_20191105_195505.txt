It’s been a year since the release of Thurston Moore’s first album, “The Rainbow,” and it has been a year of seeing his album live, or hear it in its entirety. This year, “The Rainbow” has been played at least 300 times.
But right now, the above is the first time I heard “The Rainbow,” and it is a very special record, and I always wanted to hear a record like “The Rainbow,” because’s, let me compare it to something like, you know, music that I love, a record like “The Last Waltz,” or “The Buggles,” you know and you’re looking at it, it’s just a record that’s very personal and it’s just a record that I love, and I wanted to play it live. And other than that, I would like to play it as it was meant to be played live. And I think it’s a good example of how to do it. It’s a very controlled, controlled release. It’s not a rush. It’s not a rush at all. It’s a real release. And I think that’s really important, the way they approached it. I think that’s what’s important about it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So you just don’t want to rush it out?
Todd L. Burns 
No. I think that’s ridiculous because it’s probably a good idea to do it in a way that you’re not going to rush it out. But I think it is a good example of how to do it. It’s very controlled, and you know, it’s like, “OK, I like it, I like it, I like it.” It’s cool. It’s not like, “Oh, he’s going to play ‘The Rainbow’.” No, that’s not gonna happen.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So was that the first time you heard “The Rainbow?”
Todd L. Burns 
Yeah, that was the first time I heard it. And then the following year, “I Want You Back” and “The Buggles” came out, and it was just that experience, and I always wanted to play “The Rainbow” more live. And now, “I Want You Back” is the first time I’ve heard “The Rainbow.” And now, “I Want You Back” is the first time I’ve heard “The Rainbow.”
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So, this is a very special record, right?
Todd L. Burns 
Yeah, this is the first time I ever heard “The Rainbow.” But I’m not too sure about what it was like to be there at the time, but I had a friend who was a drummer and was a drummer in his band. And he would come to the studio, and he would play “The Rainbow” a few times, and then he would leave the room, and he would play “The Rainbow.” That was the first time I heard it. And I think that’s one of the reasons why people love it, because it’s very predictable. And I always try to play the record as it was meant to be played live. I play “The Rainbow” the second time, and I play “I Want You Back.”
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Can we take one track from that?
Todd L. Burns 
Sure.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So it was the first time you heard “The Rainbow?”
Todd L. Burns 
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So you just sort of put it in a box?
Todd L. Burns 
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You can just sort of put it in a box?
Todd L. Burns 
Yeah, yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So it was a very specific time in your life that you were going to see a record like “The Rainbow.” And you were not going to see it as a record that you’re going to play live, but you were going to see it as a record that you’re going to play live?
Todd L. Burns 
Yeah.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
So, what was it like to
====================
”Tomboy”
Tomboy is a very important label, a very important label. They were also the originators of all the great house records. They had a release of 'Smoke On The Water,” Fountains of Wayne. They had a release of “Ticking Time Bomb,” which was a wonderful song. They had a release of “Blowin” by De La Soul. They had a release of “Motherfucker,” which was a very, very powerful song. They released this record in ’96. It was a very famous record that was very popular in their very first record, 1994, because this record was very powerful. I don’t know if you know of De La Soul, but that was their first record, they released this record in ’96. It was a very big record, it was one of the first records they ever released. It was a great record, I think like “Mommy Baby” by Soulsonic Force, they released this record in ’96, “Slave,” I don’t know if you know of De La Soul, but that was their first record. It was a great record, but it’s not the first record they ever released, I think they had released three records in ’96. They released “Party People”, “Slave,” which is another record that was very powerful. They released “Heaven Knows I Hear You Singin” by The Raging Rhinoceros, which was a great song. “Tomboy” is the first record they ever released.
Todd L. Burns 
Let’s play “Tomboy”, this was released in ’96, right? [plays “Tomboy”]
(music: De La Soul – “Tomboy” / applause)
Todd L. Burns 
This is “Tomboy,” I think, so you could say “Tomboy” is a major label release. I think it’s even bigger than “Slave.”
Tomboy 
Yeah.
Todd L. Burns 
I think you have a record that is probably the most high-profile record that you’ve released in a long time. How hot was that record?
Tomboy 
It’s very hot. It’s a very high-profile record, it’s a big record. Up until that time, there was no big records in the UK at that time, but De La Soul, who was De La Heart, they just released their first record at one time. They released it in 2000, which is a very important record for me. It was a big record, it was a big record. It was a big record. I think they released it in ’96. That was their first record, I think that was their first record.
Todd L. Burns 
What was it about it that made you want to do a record like that?
Tomboy 
I was like, “What’s the record?” I was like, “It’s a song called “Tomboy,” it’s a song called “Tomboy”. It was called “Tomboy,” I don’t know if you guys know, De La Soul, they released a record called “Tomboy,” it was a big record. They released “Tomboy,” “Tomboy,” which was a huge record, but it was very low-key, they released it in 2000. It was a big record, I think it’s the first record they released in the UK.
Todd L. Burns 
I think they released it in Montreal?
Tomboy 
Yes.
Todd L. Burns 
There’s a lot of fans here that are young and have a lot of musical ideas. Were you a fan of the De La Soul record, or was it something that would come up in your head?
Tomboy 
Yeah, I think it was the De La Soul record. I just remember hearing the De La Soul record, it was like “You Goin” by De La Soul, it was like “You Goin” by De La Soul. I was like, “What is this,” I started listening to De La Soul records, De La Soul records. The first record I ever heard was the De La Soul record called “Tomboy,” which was a big record. They really took it to the next level, it was a big record

====================
The closest thing to a coffee scene we have in the world is in Berlin, which is a kind of small town in the heart of a choral town. It has a very small, very beautiful park, but it is a very, very conservative city.
Gernot Bronsert
It is very central and it has a very, very small, very beautiful park that is all over the place. But it is very, very conservative and it is a very small town.
Todd L. Burns
In the beginning, it was very poor, but it has become very, very nice and it has become very, very fashionable.
Gernot Bronsert
It was, it was very ugly. It was very, very expensive. It was a very bad scene.
Todd L. Burns
There is a story about a girl who was in a coffee house and she was having coffee and she says to her boyfriend, “You have to come in and smoke weed. You have to drink coffee.” And he goes, “I am too old for coffee.” So she goes and she has a cigarette and she goes, “Yeah, yeah, yeah." And she is really poor, she has no money, she has no education, she knows nothing, she has no money.
Gernot Bronsert
She goes to the coffee house and she smokes the cigarette, and she is really poor, she has no education, she has no money, she has no education, she has no money, she goes to the coffee house and she gets a cigarette, and she goes, “Come on, you don’t know what to do, you don’t know how to get up,” because it is very, very hard to get up in the morning, so she has to go to the coffee house and she asks for coffee and she goes, “What do you have?” [laughs]
Todd L. Burns
And there is a guy.
Gernot Bronsert
Yeah, yeah.
Todd L. Burns
And he loves coffee.
Gernot Bronsert
Yeah, yeah.
Todd L. Burns
So when you get into the club, there was a lot of people who were there, but you could also go in a coffee house.
Gernot Bronsert
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Todd L. Burns
And who was there?
Gernot Bronsert
They might be you, they might be you, they might be you. It is not like you have to go to the pub, it is not like you have to go to the cinema, it is not like you have to go to the club. It is not like you have to go to the coffee house. It is not like you have to go to the cinema.
Todd L. Burns
So the thing when you go to a coffee house, is you have to pay for the coffee.
Gernot Bronsert
No.
Todd L. Burns
There was a story. And it was really funny, is that you, when you go to a coffee house, you have to pay for the coffee.
Gernot Bronsert
No, no, no, no, no.
Todd L. Burns
And then what is happening is at the time when you go to a coffee house, you have to pay for the coffee because there is a flat that you have to buy, but the thing is, that is the way it is. And the coffee shop is the very first thing you see when you come into the coffee house. And I want to play something just to give you a little bit of context. The first thing you see is a young lady with a hair cut, and she has a cigarette and she goes, “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.” You can see that a lot of people in coffee houses smoke. I went and I said, “Can you smoke?” “Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.” And the people who smoke are very, very conservative, and they say, “You have to smoke,” or “You have to drink,” or “You have to smoke,” or “You have to drink,” and they are very, very bad people. And you are a bit awkward at the time, and you are not going to get out of bed for a coffee. So you have to go to the coffee house, and you have to pay for coffee. And then you have a little piece of paper, and it is very important to be good at the coffee house.
Todd L. Burns
I think it was the same thing, I mean, at the time you had no money, and so you had to
====================
His grandkids were like, “He always had a wife.” I mean, that’s what he was, was a good person. It was like, “You see, we’re from New York, we’re a New York family.” That was the thing that made them want to get married. They’re from New York, they know the thing about love. They know how to be a good wife and a good mother and a good friend. I was like, “Well, what things are you going to do, you know?” They always wanted things. They wanted to get married. I was like, “Well, what’s it going to take?” It was a long process.
I’m like, “So you’re going to be a lawyer?” They’re like, “Oh, yeah.” I was like, “What?” They wanted to get married. I was like, “No, I don’t want to be a lawyer.” I just wanted to be my best self. I’m a good father. I love my family. I love my kids. I know what’s gonna happen. I’m not going to be here; I’m not going to be the mother of a child. I’m going to be the dad of a child because I love my family, too, and I’m going to be a good friend to your family.
Torsten Schmidt
I think that’s how you got them to get married, is to be a good father. I mean, there’s no one else in the world who’s done that. I mean, in the end, you know, in a way, I can’t put you in the same frame, but I’ve got a couple of stories about it, which is, that was inside of a studio. I’m not sure what the relationship was like. I’m going to hear from you guys. I’m going to hear from your mothers. I don’t know if you guys have any stories. I don’t know if you guys have any stories. I don’t want to hear them. I don’t want to hear your stories. I’m not trying to put you in a box of, “Oh, man, you know what you want to be.” I’m not trying to save you. I’m just telling you what you like to be. You know what I’m about. I’m here to help you get there. I’m here to make sure you’re happy. I’m here to make sure you’re happy.
Benji B      
Yeah.
Torsten Schmidt
I don’t want to hear your stories. I’m not going to hear them. I’m not going to hear your stories so much. No, I’m not going to hear your stories. I’m going to tell you when you’re going to be a lawyer. You’re going to be a lawyer. You’re going to be a lawyer. I’m going to tell you when you’re going to be married. I’m not going to tell you’re not going to be a good mother. I’m just telling you what you’re doing. I’m not telling you what you don’t know. I’m telling you when you’re going to be a mom. I’m telling you what you get to do. I’m telling you when you’re going to be a dad. I’m telling you when you’re going to be a husband.
Benji B     
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Torsten Schmidt
You’re just going to be the father, I guess, because you’re going to be the mother. I mean, that was this story. Did you guys have any questions?
Benji B     
I think we were very well-known for being a good family. It was a lot of fun. We’re not going to be talking about the marriage stuff, the wedding stuff, which is very complicated. That’s not going to be the story of the story, you know. It’s going to be the story of the love.
Torsten Schmidt
Is it just because you became famous for being a good father that you have the luxury of being a good wife and a good mother?
Benji B  
====================
A lot of people in the room have been talking about it, but there’s no real consensus on whether or not you should use the laser to make music or just do it on your own. I think a lot of people are still using it, but there’s no consensus on whether or not.
Dan Storch
Well, it’s a laser, so it’s a remnant of a laser. It’s a high frequency, it’s just a reflection of a laser. It’s not a beam, it’s a vibration. The tear and the displacement of the sound, it’s just a vibration. Usually it’s a reflection of a laser. I think it’s a good thing, but I’m not sure if it’s a good thing or not.
Audience Member
Well, it’s not a good thing.
Dan Storch
Yeah, it’s not a good thing. I think it’s a good thing. You can’t just do it on your own. You know, it’s kind of like a laser, but you’ll never make money. I mean, I’ve done some records with people that were really good, but I can’t do it. It’s not gonna sell, it’s not gonna make a little bit of money. If you’re gonna do it, you’re gonna have to pay for it. It’s gonna be a big record, because it’s gotta take money. If you’re gonna do it on your own, you can’t just do it on your own. It’s like how you do an album, you can’t just do an album on your own because you don’t have the time or the money. It’s not gonna sell, it’s gonna be a big record. So you just can’t just do it on your own, you have to pay for it. If you’re gonna do it on your own, you have to pay for it.
And if you’re not gonna pay for it, then you have to do it on your own. And if you’re not gonna pay for it, then you’re not gonna do it. It’s just a matter of money. If you’re gonna do it on your own, you’ve got to pay for it. If you’re gonna pay for it, then you’re gonna do it. You’ve got to pay for it. If you’re not gonna pay for it, then you’re not gonna do it. I can’t do it because I don’t know where I’ve ever gone to pay for it, so I’m gonna do it on my own.
And if I can’t do it, then I can’t do it, because I don’t know if I’m gonna get it done.
Audience Member
I wanted to know if you ever do a record for a $5,000 advance.
Dan Storch
No, I don’t have any money. I don’t know if I can do it, but I think I’ll do it. But I don’t think I ever’ve done anything like that. I don’t know if I’ve ever done anything like that, but I think I would do it on my own, I think it’ll sell. I might do it, but I don’t know. I’ve never done anything like that. I think I’ll do it on my own. If I can’t do it on my own, then I don’t want to do it. I’m gonna do it on my own.
Audience Member
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dan Storch
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, but I don’t think I’ll do it. I know it’s gonna sell, but I’m not gonna do it.
Audience Member
Yeah, yeah.
Dan Storch
Yeah, yeah.
Audience Member
Yeah, yeah.
Dan Storch
Yeah, yeah.
Audience Member
So, you don’t wanna go out and hire a producer.
Dan Storch
No, you’ve got to do it on your own.
Audience Member
Yeah, yeah.
Dan Storch

I used to go to clubs and I used to get a lot of fun from playing at clubs. I always had a lot of fun playing at clubs. I think I always had fun playing at clubs.
When I started playing in clubs, I wasn't a big clubber. I was a little bit bit shy. I didn't have the energy to be dancing, but I played a lot of music, and I was always a very good DJ in clubs. I was very good at it, and I would say that I was the best DJ in the club.
I started playing in clubs in the summer, and I was in a club in the summer, and I was very good at dancing.

Jesus, I’m not a Christian, I’m not in a church, I don’t want to be in a church. We have too many people here with money, so I’m not going to be in a church. I just want to be honest with you.” He just finished.
Randy Muller    
What are you talking about?
Christine Kakaire
That’s what we’re talking about. We’re talking about us coming from a Christian background. I am in a small church, and it’s not Christian. It’s not Methodist. It’s not Lutheran. It’s not Catholic. It’s not Jewish. It’s not Baptist. It’s not whatever. It’s not everything. It’s not. Where do you get spirituality in your life? If you have money, you can go to a church or you can go to a church. But if you don’t, you can’t. I want to tear down the church. I want to tear the garbage off the street. I want to tear the church down. Jesus, I’m not going to be in a church. I’m not going to be in a church. But I’m going to be honest with you. I’m going to be honest with you and I’m going to be honest with you. I’m going to be honest with you. I’m going to say, “How many people in this room are Catholic, are you?” “Come on, man, are you Catholic?” “Come on, man.” “Why don’t we put that Catholic music here?” “God bless America, God bless America.” “God bless America.”” “God bless America.” “God bless America, God bless America.” “God bless America, God bless America.” “God bless America, God bless America.”
Randy Muller    
You were talking about my first two albums, The Book of Mormon and The Resurrection of Man. What was that process like? What made you decide to make these records?
Christine Kakaire
That’s a good question. Because, as my mother was Christian, I was raised in the church. But I was raised in a very conservative, conservative, conservative church. I was a woman who was raised in a church in my home. It was not really a church, it was not a church, it was not a church, it was not a church. I was raised in a very conservative, conservative, conservative church where I was always excluded. I was never invited to church. I was never invited to sing or anything like that. I wasn’t allowed to play music, I was never allowed to dance or anything like that. I was always in the bathroom, I was always in the kitchen, I was always in the bathroom. I was always in the kitchen. I was never in the bathroom unless I was actually asked. I was always in the kitchen. I was never in the kitchen.
That was my first album. I had a record out and I used to work with the manager and I used to do all my shooting. I was a very good photographer, but I was not a good photographer. I never had any pictures of people. I never had any pictures, I never had any pictures of people. I never had any pictures of people. I never had any pictures of Jesus. I never had any pictures of Jesus. I never had any pictures of Jesus. I never had any pictures of Mary or anything like that. I never had any pictures of Jesus. I had cameras. I was pretty much a very, very good photographer, but I was not a good photographer. I was not an amazing photographer, I was not one of the best. I was a very bad photographer, just because I wasn’t a very good photographer. I was not a great photographer, I was not someone that would go out and do amazing pictures. I was not someone that would be up on a pedestal. I was not the one to go on a pedestal. I was not like that. I was a bad photographer, I was not a great photographer, I was not a great photographer, I was a bad photographer and I was a bad name. That was my first album, and that was my first album.

I’ve been listening to a lot of Christian radio programs, and I really like them. I’ve heard many people talk about Jesus, and they’re holy. I’ve heard many people talk about Jesus. It’s like, �

“You Don’t Want Her To Sleep” by Gwen Stefani
A lot of these tracks, you know, the other DJs change the whole tempo and tempo of the music, and I’m like, “What the fuck is this, you don’t want her to sleep?” But they don’t, they just put it down to the fact that Gwen Stefani is a girl, that she had to bring her glam to the world, and she just had to make these tracks. 
I just think, that’s what I’m trying to do with this whole thing, you know? It’s like, “You know what? I want you to think that’s what I want you to think, because there’s no way that you going to believe that’s what I want you to think, but you know, that’s what I want you to think,” and it’s like, “Oh, yeah, it’s Just Blaze, that’s what I want you to think.” 
Because the music that I make is about putting things together, and I think that you have to put things together, and if you want to believe that, or if you’re interested in what I do, it’s like you have to put the music together, you know? You have to put it on a track that you can play. 
You know? There’s no one right way, but if you’re into that, then you’re into it. I don’t want to be a disco queen, because that’s not me, I don’t want to be a house queen, because that’s not me. I don’t want to be a glam queen, I don’t want to be a body queen, because that’s not me, I don’t want to be a dancer, I don’t want to be a singer, because that’s not me. I want to do it all, because I want to be out there, I want to get back in the studio, I want to get back, I want to get back in the studio, I just want to be out there. I want to be on the road, I want to do it, I want to do it, I just want to do it, you know? I’m just about getting back in the studio and doing my music. But I just want to be out there, you know? I want to do the music, I’m just looking for the next big break, I’m looking for the next big tour. I’m looking for the next big album, and I’m looking for the next big record, and I’m looking for the next big tour, and I’m looking for the next big thing. 
But I’m not looking for anything in particular, and I’m really looking for what I feel is the next big thing, and I think that’s what I’m going to do with this whole thing. 
And I think that we’re going to see that this is the next big thing, so I’m looking for that. 
We’re going to see who we’re going to see again, and we’re going to see if it’s going to be Just Blaze or if it’s going to be Gwen or if it’s going to be whoever, and I’m looking at the next big thing, and I’m looking for the next big break. So I’m going to be back touring, I’m going to be back in the studio, I’m going to be back on tour, and I’m looking for the next big thing, and I’m going to be back with you. 
And I’m still here, and I’m still going to be out there doing my music. And I’ve got another album coming out. And I’m looking for the next big thing, and I’m looking for the next big break, and I’m looking for the next big thing, and I’m looking for those things that I want, and I’m looking for it, I’m looking for the next big break, and I’m looking for the next big thing, and I’m looking for the next big break, and I’m looking for the next big break, and I’m looking for the next big thing, and I’m looking for the next big thing, and I�

Audience member 
We’re living, we’re not in a studio, we’re in a hotel. How did you start the studio?
Hanna Bächer 
I started the studio as a club in the club, like a house, but more like a club than a studio. In the club you can see everybody, you can watch movies. I have a studio, a set-up, I have a soundsystem, I have a mixing desk. 
I have an oscillator, I have a mixer. I don’t have a mixer. I have a CD player, I have a laptop. I don’t have a PC, I have an iPad, I have a TV, I’ve got a little little bit of everything. It’s not a business. It’s a hobby. I don’t have anything to do, I don’t have anything to sell. I don’t want to sell anything, I just want to be happy.
Audience member 
I think that’s a very interesting point, because it’s a very traditional way of making music. It’s very traditional.
Hanna Bächer 
I think this is the first time I use sequenced music, I use a sequencer. A sequencer is really easy to use, I have a sequencer. 
I don’t have a computer, I don’t have anything. I don’t want to sell anything, I just want to be happy. I don’t want to be held back. I don’t want to be held back, I just want to be happy and I want to be this happy person. I want to be in the music industry and I want to be happy.
Audience member 
I bet you that’s something that you feel comfortable with.
Hanna Bächer 
Maybe I should talk more about our history. I started up in the early ‘80s, we didn’t even have computers, we just had an oscillator, I had an oscillator. We used to have 45-mm records, but now I have a computer, I have a laptop, I have an iPad. I think I’m just happy, I’m not too nervous, I just want to be happy, I want to be happy.
Audience member 
I’m sure you heard about this. You said you’re not really worried about money.
Hanna Bächer 
No, I’m not worried about money, I just want to be happy. I don’t want to be in a business. I just want to be happy, I want to be happy. 
Audience member 
You’ve said before that you have a lot of misconceptions about music.
Hanna Bächer 
Please, I’m not going to say anything... There’s a lot of misconceptions, I think. I think there’s a lot of misconceptions about music. People think it’s about money. I don’t want to be in the music business, I just want to be happy, and I want to be happy. It’s not about money, it’s about happiness.
Audience member 
I think that’s a very important point, because all of you mentioned did have a lot of money, did all of you?
Hanna Bächer 
Yes, we did. We had money, but we had a lot of things to worry about. A lot of things to worry about, but we didn’t have to worry about money, we just had to be happy.
Audience member 
I want to know what you think about the concept of “happy music”, because I know you’ve talked about music as a very personal thing, you mentioned in the beginning that you’re a musician, you said that you were a musician, but you also decided to want to make music in a very abstract way. When you think about it, you know that this album is not about money, although that’s an important point.
Hanna Bächer 
I think about it like this. I don’t want to be in the music business, I just want to be

Hi.
Todd L. Burns 
You mentioned that you were a big fan of old school reggae, which is interesting. What was it like growing up growing up in New York?
Todd L. Burns 
I went to quite a high school, but every day I would go to the school of the record. The rest of my generation was more into the rock bands. I was a big fan of the Black Keys, and I was into The Beatles. I was into The Rolling Stones, and I was a big fan of anything. I was into everything from jazz to jazz to hip-hop, all those genres.
There was no genre that I didn't like, and I was a big fan of jazz: John Coltrane, Charles Mingus,. I was into all of these genres, and just got into everything. I tried to be a good musician, and I played in a church. I could teach choir, but I was a strict Christian, and I didn't like to mess with other people in my church. I played in the park, and I was a big fan of all of these things.
How it started changed my life in a way. I wanted to be in the marching band, and I wanted to be in the choir. I wanted to be in the school, and I wanted to be a teacher. I wanted to be a music director, and I wanted to be a piano teacher. I wanted to be a famous actress. I wanted to be a singer, and I wanted to be a dancer. I wanted to be a dancer. I was all three of those things.
I was a little different to my peers, because I wasn't into things. It was all about what you do. And I knew what I wanted to do, so I could do it. And I knew what I wanted to leave, so I could do it. I wanted to be a real artist, because I wanted to be an artist, but I didn't want to be a celebrity.

And I also want to say that you’re here because of the music you’ve put out. I remember you saying, “Comin’,” and I remember you saying, “Comin’.” I don’t know, there’s a lot to be said for this kind of business.
Todd L. Burns 
I was born in New York. I’m three years younger than you are, but they’re close friends. We’re just friends, we listen to music, we talk about music, and we’re both super passionate about music. My music career started when I was about 4. I was playing in a church choir, and I was just like, “Wanna be big?” I was like, “I don’t want to be big, I just want to be a singer.” I wanted to be a singer, and I wanted to be a teacher, and to be a good teacher, and to be a good teacher, and to be a musician. 
I was a big fan of all things jazz, and I was a big fan of everything from jazz to jazz to hip-hop, and to be a good musician. I was into a lot of genres, and I wasn’t into a genre, so I could do it. 
I did this album, “The Rapture,” and I did “The Rapture” with my brother, and I went to college, and I ran away from home, and I went to New York. In New York, I was like a musical prodigy, and I was big into all of these things. 
When I went to college, I was in the choir, and I was playing in the church. After college, I knew what I wanted to do, but I didn’t know how to do it. I was in the choir, and I was playing in the church. I didn’t know how to play an organ, so I had a lot of questions. I had a lot of questions, and I was curious about everything. 
And I just wanted to be a good musician. I wanted to be a good teacher, and I wanted to be a good musician. 
I was a good singer
====================
I’m just in a hurry. I’m going to get back to work. But not before I’m like, “Oh, my God, I have what I should be doing.” I’m trying to do this like I do all my art. Just concentrate on just one thing, and that’s what I do. No matter how many people tell me, “Oh, you’re just a hip-hop artist, you’re just a rapper, you’re just a rapper, you don’t have much to say, you don’t have much to say, you don’t have much to say.” I don’t want to be the one saying that. I’m just a musician. I’m not a famous rapper. I’m just a musician. I don’t want to be a box of swag or anything. I just want to do music. I’m not trying to be famous or anything. I just want to do music.
I don’t want to be famous or anything. I just want to do music. I don’t want to be famous or anything. I just want to do music.
This whole thing about fame and everything, I don’t know what to say to that. I’m just going to do it. I don’t want to be famous. I’m going to do it. I’m going to do it. I don’t want to be famous. I just want to do it. I want to just do it.

“Dude, I just want to let someone know that I’m going to be on tour this year.” And I just found that concept in a record. So I just went with it.
MARK BURNS
You’re using the term “tourist” in a nice way. It’s like the word, “tourist”, has a very specific meaning and it’s a big word, it’s a big word in the United States. Do you feel like that’s an appropriate term for an artist who is traveling the world and hanging out with people? That’s the way to describe it, isn’t it?
TDAB
I don’t see it that way. I think it’s an appropriate term for a traveler. I think it’s really important to look at what it’s really about, isn’t it? What is the experience of going to a place that you can’t get back to if you go home? You know, why are you there? You know, I just went to New York a couple of years ago and I think I was in a place I never expected to be, but I’m here, I’m happy, I get a good education, I have good friends, I enjoy life, I feel good. You know, I’m just doing what I love. I’m just doing what I want to do. And I’m enjoying it. We’re looking for a long term answer, a long term answer, to what the American Dream is, and that’s what we want to accomplish, and that’s what we want to open up to people, is to open up our eyes and say, “Look, I’m a human being. I’m not going to be here forever.” I know that this, this is a long term answer. So I feel like it’s appropriate for an artist who is traveling the world and is in a place where they can’t get back to. And they just want to be human beings and they want to be happy. And I think that’s what I want to do, is create, create, create, create. So it’s just a matter of, “What can I do?” And the only thing I can do is just go out there and be a good client, maybe give them a hug, to feel good and whatever. But I want to do it for a long time. And I don’t want to be a tourist. I want to be the best client I can be. And that’s what I want to do.
MARK BURNS
You mentioned earlier that you’re in a studio with some other techno musicians and you do remixes for them. How enjoyable is it to work with them?
TDAB
It’s not an issue, it’s a matter of, “How do you like your music?” I think that’s a really important thing to know, especially if you’re going to kind of put your stamp on it. You know, you can make a good remix and it’s not going to be the same. But I do feel like it’s a quality thing, it’s a quality thing. I think that’s what it means to me, it’s a quality thing. I think that’s what it means to you, too. I mean, if you work with a DJ, you want to work with the DJ. You want to work with the DJ. And you don’t want to work with the producer, you want to work with the producer. You want to work with the artist, you want to work with the artist. And that’s what I think is a good thing to look at. And you know, that’s true, that’s true. But I think that’s it. And that’s it.

====================
In this lecture at the 2007 Red Bull Music Academy, Daniele Gherini, Chairman of the Italian Federation of Television, explained why people are so interested in Italian music, and what makes it special.
Benji B 
We're sitting here at the Red Bull Music Academy, and I have to say that I grew up listening to Italian music, and it was a very strong influence and I still listen to it and live with it in my life.
Daniele Gherini
I was born in Italy, and I arrived here in 1974.
Benji B 
And did you know that at that time, there were no Italian-American artists in the United States?
Daniele Gherini 
No, thank you.
Benji B 
What was your first exposure to Italian music?
Daniele Gherini 
My first exposure to Italian music was the radio, when I was very young, and I was listening to classical music. I was a huge fan of the Beatles, and I loved Beatles records, and I thought, “This is amazing.” I thought, “This is the best music ever.”
Benji B 
And you started to record as a producer yourself, right?
Daniele Gherini 
No, I started to record as a producer, and I didn't know it was Italian music. I didn't know what to do, because I didn't know anything. [laughs]
Benji B 
So you were listening to Italian music back then, and then you came to New York and had the chance to meet people like Morris.
Daniele Gherini 
Yeah, I was a very, very nice, very good friend.
Benji B 
Do you have any of your own things now?
Daniele Gherini 
I have a lot of Italian music magazines. I think I’ll have Madagascan, which is, “I think I’ll have a dub album.” I’ve done a dub album. I’m going to do a dub album of “Marauder” by the Greek band, “Marauder” by the Italian band, “Kronatina” by the American band, and I have a dub album. I’ve done a dub album of the Italian singers “Dorsey,” “Laravera,” and “Zappertivo.” I’m going to do a dub album of “Dorsey” by the Italian band.
(music: Dorsey – “Dorsey,” “Dorsey,” “Dorsey,” “Dorsey,” “Dorsey,” “Dorsey,” “Dorsey,” “Dorsey.”)
Benji B 
You said that you were listening to Italian music growing up. I guess you were going to the same places as everyone else, but you were listening to Italian music at a very different level from other people you know and you were listening to Italian music as a teenager.
Daniele Gherini 
Yeah, I was listening to Italian music. I was listening to American music, and I was listening to classical music, and I wanted to be like them and try to be like them, and I wanted to be Italian, and I wanted to be Italian, and I wanted to be young.
Benji B 
You spoke briefly about your first exposure to Italian music as a producer and as a teenager.
Daniele Gherini 
My first exposure was when I was 16. I was listening to Italian music for piano, and I was listening to Italian music as a teenager, and I was listening to Italian music as a teenager, and I wanted to be Italian. I wanted to be Italian, and I wanted to be an American, and I wanted to be a singer, and I wanted to be a dancer, and I wanted to be a dancer. It was more about music, and I wanted to be a dancer, and I wanted to be a producer, and I wanted to be a musician, and I wanted to be a dancer. I wanted to be Italian, and I wanted to be a singer.
Benji B 
What was it like to finally be the star of a band like that?
Daniele Gherini 
It was really extraordinary, for me, because when I was growing up, I was really poor, and I was a teenager, and I was a person who was open to all kinds of music, and I was like everybody else. It was really interesting. I had no idea about what was going on, and I wanted to be the
====================
It’s tough to put a band together, because they’re always new people, they’re always looking for a new sound. They don’t know what to do, so you can’t know what to do. Then they need to think about the people in the band, who are good at what they do, and they’re looking for the next thing.
For me, I think I was lucky because I was around Tommy Boy, and they were, like I said, I’m a fan of their music, and I’m a fan of their music, and I wanted to be like them, but I was in a band, and I don’t know what to do, because they’re always looking for a new sound. I think from their point of view, they’ll always be in the business, and they’re always looking to do something new and different, and you can’t figure out what to do, because they’re always looking to do something new and different. I think that was the thing that made me more successful in the band, that I’m around them, and they’re looking for something new. They’re always looking for new directions.
Torsten Schmidt 
You’re talking about basically creating the blueprint of a record, a blueprint of a career.
David Nerattini 
Yeah, they’re not in their record there, and they don’t want to be in their record there. They’re just doing their thing. They’re doing their thing, and they’re not looking for anything else. They’re looking for a new direction, so they’re always looking for a fresh direction. I think that’s what made me successful. It’s always like that with them, and I think that’s what made me successful, because I’m not tired of being there, so I don’t need to be there, believe it or not. I don’t want to be there, because I don’t want to be there. I’m not tired of the job I’ve got to do. I’m tired of it all, so I just want to do it my way. I’m happy to be there, I’m happy to be here, and I’m happy that they’re looking for a new direction, and I want to do it my way. I’m just happy to be here. That’s what I want to do.
Torsten Schmidt 
We have two of the records that you’ve done in your band, “2004” and “The Odyssey”. You have a record that’s been out there for quite a long time. Could you tell us a bit about the time? Let’s say for a second that you’ve been in it for five years, and that’s for you. You’ve been in this band for quite a long time. You’ve made quite a few records, and you have a record out there, and you have some other records out there, and you have your first couple of records out there, which are pretty good. Can you tell us a little bit about that time?
David Nerattini 
It was a lot of fun. I was in my first band, I was in the second band, I was in the third band, and I was in my last band, which was one of the last bands. We did two albums, we did one movie, and we did a couple of records. I was in the top three at the time, but I wasn’t very successful, so I decided to come back, and I played in the top three. Then the second album, “The Odyssey”, was a big hit, and I played in that movie, and then the third album was a big hit. I did “The Age” and I’ll play “The Age” tonight, and I’ll play “The Age” next.
Torsten Schmidt 
Can you play us one of the songs from that period?
[music: David Nerattini – “The Age”]
David Nerattini 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was “The Age.”
Torsten Schmidt 
That was “The Age,” right?
David Nerattini 
Yeah.
Torsten Schmidt 
It’s not your typical rock record, it’s like an alternative take on something.
David Nerattini 
It’s still an American version of rock. It’s really a modern version
====================
What was your first impression of the place?
Benji B
I was very early, I was six! I was always a little bit older than everyone else. I was always playing in the breakdancing scene and I always had a lot of friends, which meant that a lot of people had a lot of money and I could just be there and just put out music. I never had any problems with the police or anything, I was always happy in my neighborhood.
Torsten Schmidt
Was it right to be a homeless kid in Brooklyn?
Benji B
That was my first experience. There was a homeless guy in the street and I was just like, “Hey, I don’t know what to do with myself.” I was always doing my own thing. I felt like I was just going to do it on my own. I was always doing my own thing. I was always that way. I was always living alone. I was never seen as having anything to do with other people.
Torsten Schmidt
And you were probably wondering why you’re sitting here?
Benji B
Well, I was and I was then homeless, but I had no problem with the police. I was just doing my own thing, but I definitely had problems with the police. I definitely had problems with the law. I had problems with my neighborhood. I was always having trouble with the police.
Torsten Schmidt
And what kind of problems?
Benji B
The police was always very nice to me, but they really didn’t care about me. They were always protecting other people, and they were always helping people. I was always helping other people. I wasn’t here to be a problem to them. I was there to help myself.
Torsten Schmidt
So you were always homeless?
Benji B
Yeah, I was homeless. I was a homeless kid, and I was always feeling like I was going to be good, and I just had no problem with it at all. I was never seen as having anything to do with other people, I was always just me. I was always just me. I was always happy. I was never seen as having anything to do with other people.
Torsten Schmidt
How did you meet your husband?
Benji B
Well, my husband was a musician, he was a musician and he was very smart. He was a really good musician, and I was always a bad drummer and a bad singer, and he was never good at anything. He was never good at anything. I mean, we’re together now, and we’re doing fine.
Torsten Schmidt
So, did you have any problems with the police?
Benji B
No, I didn’t have any problems with them. I wanted to be good. I wanted to get out of the way and just be happy. I wanted to be good, and I was always happy.
Torsten Schmidt
How did you meet your husband?
Benji B
I met my husband at a club called New York City. For some reason, he had a lot of love for me. I was always a good listener, and he was always nice to me. I was always good to him. I was always good to him, and we just got to know each other quickly.
Torsten Schmidt
So you started working with him right away?
Benji B
Yeah, that was my first experience working with him. I just came over from the breakdancing. I didn’t know what to do with myself. It was just something we just worked out and did what we wanted to do.
Torsten Schmidt
So, was it right to be homeless in New York?
Benji B
No, never! I never had any problems with the police. I never had any problems with the law. I never had any problems with anything. I never had any problems with money, because I never had any money, and I never had any problems with anything. I never had any problems with anything. I always just wanted to be happy. I never had any problems working with him, and I never had any problems working with him as a manager.
Torsten Schmidt 
So, you were always living in the same neighborhood?
Benji B
Well, I was always living in the same neighborhood. I was always sleeping in the same park, and I was always saying, “Don’t get me out of here,” because I was always homeless. I was always in the same neighborhood. I’m always moving around. I was always living in that same neighborhood.
Torsten Schmidt
So, how did you meet your husband?
Benji B
Well, I had a lot of friends, and I was always around my friends, and they always were supportive. I was always around my friends, and
====================
So, first of all, it’s not about the song or the artist or anything, it’s about the music. I mean, I’m from Miami, so I’m kind of the first one to do it, so I’m kind of the first one to do it. But at the same time, it’s just about the music. It’s about the music, and it’s about the people that make the music. It’s about the people that make the music. The people that make music. And it’s about the people that make it. 
Some people make it, some people don’t make it, but this does happen. It’s a big thing. I mean, when I did it, I think I had maybe 40,000 people listening to it, and I used to do that to a lot of people that. It’s a huge thing. There’s a lot of people who have done it, so it’s a big thing. 
But the people that make music? I mean, it’s been a lot of people in this room. I’ve done it, and I feel like I’ve done it right. I’ve done it right and I’m proud of it. It’s only my first album. I don’t know if anybody in here has done it. But I do it. I just think that’s the way I’m doing it. I don’t want to be that person, too, that’s on the second album, because I’ve done it, and it’s one of my best albums ever. I think it’s my first album I made, and it’s going to be very good. 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt 
What were you thinking when you made it?
Randy Muller 
I thought it was going to be very good. It’s not going to be very good. It’s not going to be a big hit. I think it’s going to be a hit. But I wanted to do it a certain way. I wanted to do it with a song, but I didn’t want to be somebody who’s like, “What’s the song?” I didn’t want to be somebody that you could say, “That’s my song.” I’m not going to be like, “Here’s my song.” I want to do it with a track. A track is a lot of fun. I mean, I think I’ve done it with a track, but I just don’t know. I started it off as a remix, but I was not like, “Oh, that’s my song.” I started it off as a remix. I think I did that first. I was like, “OK, that’s my first album.” And it just kind of happened. That’s how it started. I just wanted to do it my way, and I just saw it as the best thing I could do, and I started doing it. 
I think that’s what it’s all about. There’s no special taste to it, just because it was my first album, and I just wanted to do it my way. I just wanted to do it with a song, but I didn’t want to be someone that you could say, “That’s my song.” I want to do it my way, and I just thought it was my best song ever. 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt 
What was it like to work with someone like you in Miami, with the rap background?
Randy Muller
It was great for me, I was working with a really good producer, and I was working with someone that was a really good producer, and that was really good. I was working with a really good producer, and that was good, and also I was working with people who were doing really good stuff, too, and it was good. I was working with a really good producer, and it was good. I was working with a good producer, and that was good. I was working with a really good producer, and that was good, too. I was working with a really good producer, and that was good.
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt 
Did you ever meet the artist before you did the album? 
Randy Muller 
No. I met her when I was doing the album, so I came over to her house
====================
I think one of the biggest DJs in the world right now is Kevin Parker, who is a fantastic producer, he’s got the most incredible beats and he’s got all these records. In my opinion, he’s the king of house. He’s got all the records that I’m talking about. He’s got all the records that have been on the radio for the last 18 year, but he’s got it labeled in his style. He used to make records like some of the very classic records like Jay-Z, all the classic records of the time, like Soulsonic, all the classics like that. But he doesn’t do house, he’s done house, but he’s not really doing house, he’s just doing house. 
I’m not sure he even cares about house, he’s not going to pay for the house. But I know he’s going to make a record and he’s going to do a record. But I think he’s doing house. I don’t know why, but I think houses, they’re just so important. They’re like the foundation of house music. They’re the foundation of what house music is, what house music is to me. If I’m going to do house, I’m going to do house. 
I want to make sure we have a lot of house music, because I think I’ve been a DJ for four years, and I know I’ve been a DJ for four years. I’ve had a couple of house records, but I’ve had a lot of house music. I think I have a lot of house music, but I don’t know if I have it, because I have a lot of house music. I’ve got some house music. From being a DJ for four years, I know that house artists have something special, their belts are made in the house, they have great records, they’re going to do a record, they’re going to do a remix. I think more people should buy house music, because house music is so important. It’s not just house artists, it’s like everyone has their own sound. I’ve had a lot of house artists, but I’ve had some house artists, but I’ve heard the same things. I think that’s what I’m missing. I want to show you guys what house music has to offer, but I think what we’re going to hear is what house has to offer. 
You need to know this, because records that are great records, they’re going to be out there on the radio. I don’t know if you guys are going to buy a record like that, but you know what I’m talking about. I want to show you guys, house is great records. People know what house music is, they know what house is, they know what house is to me. I want to show you guys what house music is about, but I’ve got a record out right now that I wanted to show you guys, but I didn’t want to be on the radio or promote this record. So I’m going to get a record out, but I’m not going to promote it because I don’t want to be on the radio or promote it. I want to be out there doing what I can to make sure that you guys have a good sound system because there’s so much stuff out there. The world is a better place if people were buying house music, but house is so important. I want to show you guys what house is about, but I do think that’s what I’m missing, but I’m not going to be on the radio or promote this record. I want to make sure you guys have a good sound system, because I think when you have a good sound system, you have a better sound, you can make records faster. But just because you have a good sound system, doesn’t mean that you can make records faster. You can have a good sound system, but you have to have a good sound system and a good sound system, and a good sound system is going to make a record that’s going to help you guys if you’re doing house. 
You know what I’m saying? If you’re doing house music, you can make records faster than a DJ. You’re going to make records faster than a DJ, because you’re going to have to do some edits. If you’re doing house music, you can make records faster than a DJ. You know what
====================
david.mccaddie@gizmodo.com<|endoftext|>Three years ago, there was only talk about the idea of a
party, which was all about the music, was about the spark, was about the passion. Now there are now a lot of people in the US
who are seeing the power and the potential of the club atmosphere and the vibe it can bring. And they have
understood music as something inextricably linked to the possibility of
having a party, which is this idea of the party itself, which is the power
of the atmosphere to be able to have a live experience. It gives you a chance to
experience something new, which is something that you can't get at a party. You can at a
party, but you can't at a party because it's about the drama, because you
get a glimpse of what it could be like if you just had a few good people, people who are
interesting, people who are doing their thing, people who have a lot of energy, and a
lot of people who want to be part of it. Everybody wants to be part of it. I don't think it
isn't possible. And there’s a big difference between the two, because at a club, you
have to make it a big deal, people who are interested in music, who want to be part
of the experience, and who want to be part of it, and who can be part of it. Because at a
party, if you have a few good people, it’s very easy to do a great job. You know, if you have a
DJ, all you need to do is do their thing, and do it great. I love a lot of people in the US,
but I think a lot of them think about what they do as entertainment, it’s not
about that. It’s about the possibilities, and the possibilities of music, whether it’s
part of a celebration or a celebration. It’s about the possibility of
being good, and you know, being good in a club is about having fun, and having a
good time. And I think everybody has a great opportunity to be part of the
experience. I just think we’re fortunate because we have the opportunity to be in
the moment and be with the people who are doing their thing and being very
positive. It’s very difficult to live your life like that, because that’s what
we do, it’s not about looking at things the way you look at things, it’s about
being positive, and being the best you you you can possibly be, and being the
best you can be in that moment. I think we’re fortunate that we have
this opportunity to do it. It’s just a different thing from where we’re at right now, because
there’s no one saying, “Oh, my friend, he’s going to be there, he’s
going to be in the club.” It’s almost like, “He’s not going to be there, he’s going to be
out of a job.” It’s like, “How can you be good if you’re not there?” But
we have to be out in the moment, and we have to be certain, because the
soul is there, and we have to believe it.

I think that you’re right. I think that the possibility of the party
having a whole other life is something that people don’t see. I think we have
the most amazing party
experience in the world, and I think that’s something that you’re talking about,
and you’re talking about when you’re talking about the music, when you’re
talking about the music
you’re listening to. It’s very hard to see that, and it’s not something you can
get at a party, it’s something you can’t get at a party.
Chris Stein 
I think that anyone who has seen a movie, especially at a party,
you’ve seen this movie. It’s not the movie anymore, it’s the soundtrack. And
I think that’s the beauty of it. It’s about the experience, and the
moment, and that’s something that you can’t get at a party. You can
get at a party, but it’s a different experience, it’s a different
time.
