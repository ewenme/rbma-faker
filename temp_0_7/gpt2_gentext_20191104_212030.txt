Warren Zevon, who wrote and played the album, had been working with Mr. Garth Brooks, who we had worked with on this album. The stuff that was heard in the club was all recorded in the bathroom, in the bathroom. We would play records, ask for samples, and then we would go and dance because we were in a club called the Chorale Club, which was a huge club on the West End. We would start to make beats and then we would go in the club and go to the bathroom and then we would start to dance. That was the first time we ever performed in the club. I was seven years old when we performed in the Chorale Club.
Daniel Bressan, who was our drummer, I was five years old when we performed. We started to perform in the Chorale Club, and we would perform in the Chorale Club.
Garth Brooks, who was our bass player, was a big influence on us. If you know the same music that we were making, you will know what to do with it and how to do it. There is no formula, but I can show you a few. I love this song, this record, I love this record, but we were just trying to do something different.
Toby Drill, who was our drummer, he also wrote the song. We would play the bass line, and we would go into the bathroom and basically do a dance. It was just us trying to do our own thing and doing something different. We would go in the bathroom, and then we would go to the bathroom and do a dance. That was the first time we ever performed in the bathroom.
It was just us trying to do something different. We would go in the bathroom. We would do our own thing, and then we would move onto the next one. Maybe we could do more stuff, but we were trying to do something different. We would go in the bathroom, and then we would move on to the next one. That was the first time we ever performed in the bathroom.
I wanted to do something different and I wanted to do something different. I think we were doing a lot of stuff, but then we would go and do another one, and then we would do another one. We would do another one, and then we would do another one, and then we would do the last one. It was just too much. It was too much for the club. We had to do it in the bathroom, and then we would go to the bathroom and just do a dance and do another dance.
The third song, which was called “Lab Man,” we did this record. It was called “Lab Man,” and it was raining, and we were like, “OK, we just turn the lights off and we just go in the bathroom.” It was raining, and we would have to play in the bathroom, just in the bathroom. We would play in the bathroom, and then we would go to the bathroom and do a dance. That was the third record we ever performed in the bathroom.
We would play the song, and then we would go back in the bathroom to do a second song, and when we were in the bathroom we would do a song and go back to the bathroom. It was just too much. It was too much for the club. We had to do it in the bathroom, and then we would go to the bathroom, and we would do our first song. We would do our second song. Then we would do our third song.
Daniel Bressan, our drummer, he was the one who was in the bathroom, and he was the one who would do the first song. It was like a song and a dance, but it was just too much. We had to do it in the bathroom, and then we would go back to the bathroom and do another song. That was our first record, and we had a lot of records and we were doing them. We had a lot of records, and we were doing a lot of different stuff, and we would do a lot of different stuff.
When we got to the West End, and we had a lot of songs, we would do a lot of different things. We would go to the West End and we would do a lot of different things. We would take a long time to do a song, and we would make a lot of different records. We would have a lot of ideas, and we would do them, and we would get it right. We would get it to the right time.
When we got to the West End, we would do a lot of different things, and we would do them right. It was just too much for the club. It was too much to do in a bathroom. It was too much to do it and you just dance and you just listen, and you follow. There was always something going on
====================
Now if you want to make a
record, you get your money and you get what you want, you get all the money that you want for music. And the records that come out, they’re not just going to be so good… I think most people in
the industry would agree with that. And it’s the same with most records. I think
the reason why a record like “Bambu” is so good is because it’s not a record that
everyone is going to be familiar with,, it’s one that everybody is going to be familiar with. And
then the next record that comes out, every time that comes out, I think people are going to
get into it right away. I think that’s what you get for having a good record, because the
image that you get from that record is that you get a big crowd. A big crowd, you’ll have a record
listening party, and see
people in suits, and hear people playing. And it’s a big crowd. If you want to make a record, you get a big crowd, and you get to see people in suits and they’ll play it at listening parties. And I think that’s a big part of the appeal of it. And that’s what I’ve
got. I think you can put a record out and I think it will sell 100,000 copies. And that’s the
deal. I don’t know how much you guys will get for it. I’m trying to get a
record for $2,000, $3,000, but I have no money. So, I want to do it for less, because a
record like that, I will put out a record that will sell 100,000 copies, maybe. And you know,
it’s just not going to be a hit record, it’s going to be a dance record, and that’s the deal.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I’ll take $2,000, and then I put out a record for $3,000, and that’s the deal.
Audience Member 
The record that I made, I’m trying to get it to be $3,000 with my record label. I’ve been trying to get my record to $2,000 for years, and I’m trying to get it to $3,000, and I’m just trying to get it to $3,000.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Well, I guess the last record was for $1,000, because it was a novelty record that nobody would be familiar with. But I know it’s a very good record, and I want to do it for less. I’ve been doing it for years. I’m just trying to do it for less money, because I don’t know how much more I’m going to get for it. I’m just making this record for the money.
Audience Member 
Absolutely.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Yeah, that’s the way it works. I don’t know if you guys can help me with the $1,000, because I do have an
account. I’m sorry. I’m not familiar with the system. I don’t know how to get a record
for $3,000. I don’t know if you guys have any ideas for your record. I have a record
for $2,000, and I want to do it for less, because I don’t know if I can get my record to $3,000, and I don’t know if I can get it to $3,000. But I’m just thinking about it and trying to do it for less. I want to do it for less money, because I don’t know how much more I’m going to get for it. My record is for $1,000. I’m not going to sign it, I’m not going to pay for it. I’m just thinking about it. And I’m not signed to any label. I’m sure that you guys have the names, and I will be signing them. But I’m no longer signed to any company. I’ve got my own label now, and I’m based in Los Angeles.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Here’s a question. Do you think that if you have a record that you can get to $3,000, you’re going to do it for less money? Because that
====================
Ennio Morricone was quite a man.
DAVIDE BORTOT 
Maurice Wilson was the first composer to make a film and the first to use a score in a film.
MARK GÜMEISTER 
I was in a club in Berlin, he was in a club in Los Angeles, I think, in New York. He used to cut the score and play it, and he would do a score within the movie. That was a very prominent role for him. I used to play with him. I used to play with him for a long time. He used to look at me and he would say, “What are you doing?” I was like, “Well, I’m not doing anything,” and he would say, “You’re crazy!” 
DAVIDE BORTOT 
I think he also did quite a lot of movies. I know it’s difficult to remember. He was very prolific because he worked with a lot of different artists from New York to Los Angeles. I don’t know if you know Roy Orbison, he worked with Bryan Ferry. It was a very big deal. He had a lot of work with Bryan Ferry, and obviously, I had no problems with him, but he did some big movies too, I think.
MARK GÜMEISTER 
I was lucky because I lived in Los Angeles in the same apartment as you, and I wanted to go to LA... I didn’t know if you guys were familiar with the Los Angeles thing, but you do see people from LA everywhere, but you don’t see anyone like Maurice Wilson here, you might be looking for a film. It’s quite complicated. I think that’s the real big deal. He was a big influence on me.
DAVIDE BORTOT 
How important was he?
MARK GÜMEISTER 
He was a big influence on me, and I really miss him. I don’t know why, because we’re talking about a great man, and he was a great artist, and he was a great musician, and I could give him a hand.
DAVIDE BORTOT 
Where did he live?
MARK GÜMEISTER 
He lived in LA. He was very wealthy, he had a very nice apartment. It was really, really nice. I think he had a nice house, and he lived in a really nice apartment.
DAVIDE BORTOT 
I think we’ve talked about you a lot, and we’re finally going to get to the real passion of working with Maurice Wilson.
MARK GÜMEISTER 
He was a big influence on me, and he was a big influence on my career, so I think that’s the big takeaway. I think that’s what he did for me, was make movies, so that was very important for me. I only did one movie with him, and he was really a big influence on me, because he was a big influence on me in the making of films.
DAVIDE BORTOT 
There are a lot of people who have worked with him. What was the most important one, is the one you worked on with Bryan Ferry?
MARK GÜMEISTER 
Yes, Bryan Ferry was the biggest influence, for me. There was even a time when I was in Los Angeles I didn’t have a script. Bryan Ferry was the guy who wrote “The Boat,” and he wrote “The Day.” He wrote “The Day,” and he wrote “The Day.” I think he was the biggest influence. He was a big influence on me, and also, if I don’t give Bryan Ferry credit, but I think he was one of the biggest influences on the music business.
DAVIDE BORTOT 
Did you know him from where you were in LA?
MARK GÜMEISTER 
I only knew him from my apartment, and it was a really good experience. I only had a couple of beers, I was in Los Angeles, and I could hear him in the club music, and I needed him to be there. He was a big influence on me, because he was a big influence on the way I worked, and also, I think he’s the biggest influence in music. He’s a big influence on me, because he was a big influence on me in the making of music, and also, Bryan Ferry was a big influence on me in coming up with my ideas, and also, I think he was one of the biggest influences, for me.

====================
We have our A-backs here.
Toby Laing 
Right, right.
Clare Fitzgerald 
I was in the A-backs. I was in the A-backs for a year and a half. I was in the A-backs, and they were my first time in London. I got a job as an assistant manager and I was the first person there. I was the first person to try and sell a record. I was the first to try and sell a band to go to a club. I was the first to try and sell a club to go to a club. I was the first to try and sell a club to go to a club.
Toby Laing 
You were from a working class background, and you were trying to make it. You had a lot of experience, and you kind of went into it with a bit of an audience. That was the thing, you wanted to sell records, and you wanted to hustle.

I was in the A-backs, and I was in the A-backs for a year and a half.
I was never really able to get to the bigger clubs, and I was always not able to get to bigger clubs. I was never able to get to the big clubs.
Toby Laing 
You were working with a lot of people when you were there, and you worked with the A-backs, and you just sort of kind of managed to keep it all together.
Clare Fitzgerald 
Yeah, I was working with a lot of people. I did a lot of gigs, but I was working in the A-backs. I was working with a lot of people. I was working on a lot of different tracks. I was working with a lot of different people. I was working with a lot of different musicians, and I was working with the producers.
When I was working in the A-backs, I was working with a lot of different musicians. I was working with a lot of different producers. I was working with a lot of different musicians. I was working with a lot of different musicians. It was like a lot of different things. I was having a lot of fun. I was having a lot of fun, and I was having a lot of fun. I was always having a lot of fun. I always had a lot of fun.

Clare Fitzgerald 
We were working with a lot of different people. We were
====================
We are here to hear about my experiences with the internet
at that time. My experience is that in those days, you had to
find your own music. You had to find your own records. If you had
a record, you had to get it signed. You had to produce it. You had
to sell it. You had to get it out. I was lucky because I had some great
friends and I was still in high school when I was making my first record. It was
like, “What the fuck is it?” I can’t really explain, but that’s what was
going on. It was like, “Look, we have to find your record, you can’t make it here.” You have
to find it in a record store. You have to do it at a record store or someone has to do it in
the studio. You have to find a record publisher. You have to make it publically available. You have
to do that. You have to get a record signed. You have to get a record out. You have to
find a publisher. You have to start making money from it. You have to make it out of a
record store. I don’t know what it takes, but I think it takes about a year or two
to get a record certified. 
That’s what we’re talking about. We’ve been in the business for about 10 years, but that was
about the time where I really started to feel like I was doing something that wasn’t right. I
started to feel like I was doing something that wasn’t right. I started to feel like it was
an industry that was taking advantage of me. It was taking advantage of me to make
money. I started to really make it difficult for them to get something that they wanted.
A lot of people don’t know the history of how the internet works, but it was
almost like every time I would go out on tour, I would see the DJs and I would go: “This is the DJ
that can put you on the radio.” They would be like, “Can you put out a record?” I would go: “No, I’m not
going to do a record.” And they would say, “Well, what do you do?” And I
would say, “I’m going to do a record.” And they would be like, “Well, what do you do
now?” And I would say, “I’m going to do a record.” And they would be like, “Well, what do you do now?”
I would say, “I’m going to do a record.” And then I would go back to the DJ, and I was like: “What the hell is this
doing?” “What’s going on?” I would say, “I’m going to do a record.” And the DJ would be like, “What the fuck do you do?” I would say, “I
don’t know, I don’t know what it is.” And he would say, “Well, what do you do?” I will say to him [laughter], “You’ve got to make money with your record.” 
I will say to you, “If you want to make money, you have to go to the record store, find a record, get it
certified.” You can’t really explain, but it is what it is. I was lucky to have some great friends
and I know what I’m talking about, and I know what this is about, and I know what
you’re talking about. 
But I do want to say that the DJ’s mentality is, “Hey, I have to do this
record.” The record shop manager is dead, so the record shop is not going to be interested,
so the record shop is not going to be interested. The record shop is going to pay you, but it’s
not going to be on your record. So you’re going to have to do it yourself. And it’s
not going to be on your record. It’s going to be on a DJ’s record. And it’s going to be on
a label. And if you do that, you know what you’re doing. And if you do that, you have to
make your own money off it. 
So if you have a record signed,
====================
What is a Digital Audio Tape?
It’s not a studio-built tape because it’s not a studio system. It’s recorded in the same way that you record a CD. It’s a digital tape that’s recorded in the same way that a CD is recorded. It’s produced by a computer and it’s audio. It’s recorded and it’s digital. 
You can buy a record for a million bucks or 500 bucks, but they won’t play it because it’s not a CD, it’s a cassette. So, it’s not a studio-built record, it’s a digital record. I think we’re going to have a track in this year, which is a cassette in a year. 
I think the reason why a record is expensive is because you can’t build a soundsystem, it’s not a soundsystem. It’s not a soundsystem you can put in your car, which you can, but it’s a soundsystem, it’s a rig. It’s not a soundsystem you can put on your turntables, which is a soundsystem. So, you can’t have a record, it’s not a record you can put in your car, it’s a record. 
So, it’s a soundsystem that’s not made by a studio, it’s made by computers. So, it’s not a soundsystem you can put in your car, it’s a soundsystem that you can put in your car. 
I think if you have a track record, you can do an album, you can do a movie, anything you want to do, you can do a track record. I suppose if you have a record that’s not a CD, you can sell it. I mean, if you have a record that’s a CD, you can sell it. I think we’re going to have one in the fall. 
When I look at the records, I look at the records and I look at the boxes, the records are usually records that you can buy for a million bucks or under, they’re usually records that you can buy for just $5 or $10. 
It’s not a box that’s made of plastic, it’s a box made of wood. It’s a box that’s made of wood. People get me, and they say, “Oh, you got a box of records.” I say, “No, I got a box of records.” “Oh, you got a box of records.” “No, I got an album.” “Oh, you got an album.” “No, I got a CD.” It’s a good record to buy, it’s a good record to buy. 
The thing is, you can’t make a record and sell it for $150, $200. You can’t do that. It’s not going to be a good record. But if you get a good record, you sell it and it’s a good record. If you make a record and sell it, it’s a good record, it’s a good record. It’s not a good record to sell, it’s a bad record to sell. 
Audience Member   
Yes, I’m back in the UK.

Why don’t we just listen to the record and say if it was made by a studio or a mixing engineer or a mastering engineer or a drum set or a keyboard or a piano?

ISLAMABAD: A good deal? The State of Pakistan is the largest producer of seasonal food in the world. In fact, the State of Pakistan won an honour when it won the Best Food Award at the Red Bull Music Academy, and they have been very good at marketing and they have been good at getting through the media.
Toby Laing
So, people are talking about Pakistan in a very positive way, because this is the country where I grew up, and I was told that if I want to be a journalist, I could write a book, I could do a documentary, I could do a documentary. But I was warned that if I wanted to be a journalist, I could write a book, I could do a documentary. If I wanted to be a journalist, I could do a book. If I wanted to be a journalist, I could do a documentary. 
But, actually, I have a very good feeling about Pakistan. I like it very much. I have lived in Pakistan for a long time, and I am going to say it right now, because I grew up in Pakistan and I was educated and I have lived here and I have worked in the field of food. I have studied the history of food. I have listened to documentaries and I have been really fascinated with what is going on in Pakistan. I just want to say, I have been here, I have worked in the field of food and I have been fascinated with what is happening in Pakistan. 
As I said, my parents, my grandparents, they were farmers. They worked in the fields and they produced food and they were very well-educated and they were very educated, and they also had a good sense of humor. They were very strong and they were very strong people. 
When I was younger, I wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer or a photographer. I wanted to be a teachers, I wanted to be a football player, I wanted to be a musician. But, at that time, I saw that it was a lot easier to become a doctor or a lawyer or a photographer than it was to become a journalist or a journalist or a music producer. So, I wanted to be a journalist because that was what I wanted to do, and I wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer or a photographer. But, at the same time, I wanted to be a religious worker or a Muslim leader or a teacher, because that was what was important. I wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer or a teacher, but, at the same time, I wanted to be a journalist. 
This country, this diversity, this culture and this diversity, I want to give it back, because I feel very proud and privileged to live here. 
I think it is very important, because this country was very important for me, because my parents worked very hard and they had to work very hard to be the best, and they are very loved and very respected and very respected. They are very well-known and they are very well-known, but they are just a very small part of Pakistan. I have been here and I have been so happy for so many years that they are here, but now we have to cheer for them so that they can continue to stay happy and healthy. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER
I know that you have touched on the issue of racism, but when you were talking about you as a young man, you were talking about being a rapper before you were a journalist, what was your experience of racism at that time? 
Toby Laing
That is absolutely true! [laughter] 
AUDIENCE MEMBER
We are talking about your experiences and what you thought of people who were different. 
Toby Laing
Yes, I was very privileged, because I was in a very privileged family, and I was surrounded by so many people. My family was very, very wealthy, and my father, my grandfather was very rich, and my mother, my sister, my sister-in-law, my brother, my friends, my children, all were very happy. But, at the same time, at that time, I wasn’t aware of Islam, and I wasn’t aware of what was happening in the country. I was just a young girl, and I was very naive, and I was just trying to be something that I was able to do. I just wanted to be a good person, and that was my goal. That was my first goal. 
I think my first goal was to help people, to help people express their sentiments, and then, my second goal was to help people relate to their own feelings, and then, my third goal was to help people express their feelings. 
I was always a kind person, and I was always willing to help people, so it was a great thing to be part of the world, and I wanted to help people.

Some of the best tracks of the year are from Chicago, but don't be fooled by Chicago's reputation. 
Nick Dwyer
But you’d never guessed that? I mean, Chicago is a very Chicago-y city, and you don’t get that much attention, but it’s been around for a long time, and it’s a very diverse city. It’s a great city for music, it’s a great place for people to live, it’s a great place to work, it’s a great place to work in. But it’s also very difficult to find good music in the city. For instance, in Chicago, it’s very difficult to find records, because it’s very conservative, and everything has to be good before it’s released in Chicago, and there’s a lot of things in Chicago that are very different from the Chicago thing. For example, Chicago’s population is 15% Hispanic, they have a lot of different cultures and different ethnicities. They don’t get a lot of attention, and so on.
It’s important to know that, because Chicago is an interesting city, and the city has a lot of it's own charm, it’s got its own culture, but the rest of the country is a very diverse city, and if you listen to the records, they’ll be really difficult to find if you’re not from Chicago. 
I think Chicago is a great city to work in, in the sense that if you’re from Chicago, it’s worth it. If you’re from New York, it’s not worth it, but if you’re from New Jersey or somewhere else, it’s definitely worth it. 
If a record like E-40 is in your city, it has to be good, because the music industry doesn’t want to push records out of the city, because it’s very difficult to get good music from Chicago. If you’re doing a record, you need it to be good, because it’s difficult to get good music from New York. It’s not easy to get good music from New Orleans. It’s really hard to get it from Milwaukee, it’s not easy to get good music from LA. It’s very difficult to get good music from New York, and so on. 
It’s just a matter of finding good music, and then you just have to make sure that you’re making good records, and your record gets out there. That’s the main thing. 
Torsten Schmidt
It’s just a matter of getting the right person. 
Nick Dwyer
Exactly. I think I’ve done very well with my label. I’ve done very, very well with my label. I’ve had a very good years, and I’ve done very well in my life, I’m still here, I’m still promoting myself and I’m still touring, I’m still doing all these things. I’m always doing everything I can to promote myself, and do these things that I’m proud of, because I’m not doing a lot. I’m not touring the world, I’m not doing a lot. It’s just been a good year. 
Torsten Schmidt
I mean, you’ve said you’re not going to be around for a long time. 
Nick Dwyer
I don’t think I’m going to be around too long, because I’m not going to be around too long. I’m not going to be in my studio forever, I’m not going to be with my family, I’m not going to be with my friends forever, I’m going to be working in a studio, and I’m still touring and raising kids, and I’m still doing all these things, and I’m not going to be around long. 
Torsten Schmidt
In the work you do, there’s a lot of pressure. 
Nick Dwyer
Yeah, I mean I’m going to be around for a long time, but I’m not going to be around forever. I’m not going to be around forever, because I’m going to be like my mom, I’m going to have my kids, and I’m going to have to work at something, and work for something that’s not my job, because I’m going to have to work at my job.

====================
So, you were a young man and a talented producer, the kind of people that we know you were. What about your day-to-day, what did you do?
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
Well, I was in my studio early in the morning. I would be in the studio. I would make music. I would do some music and I would do some things. I would go aside and do my thing. You know what I mean? I would just get some music and I would listen to it and then I would go back to the studio, and I would do something. Then when I am in the studio I would go back to the studio and watch and see what music was good. And I would go back and do something. I would go back to the studio, and I would make music and I would do something. I do this every day. 
Melanie Harris 
I guess, for the time being, you are a musician, a producer and a musician. What are the elements that you sort of added to your life that you use in your work?
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
I am not saying that I am a music producer, but I made music, and I do music. I love music. I was a musician in my youth. I was a musician in my youth. And I also love music. And I love my friends, and I love my family. And I love music. And I love everything. I love food, I love music, and I love to be creative. And I love to think. And I love to do stuff. And I love to think. And I love to do things. And if I have a good idea, I want to do it. And I guess that is what I am. I am not a famous person, but I am a musician. I am a musician, and I like music. I am a musician, and I am very good at music. And I want to be a musician, and I want to be good at music. And I want to be good at everything. 
Melanie Harris 
What kind of music do you like? What are you playing now?
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
I like music in my music, I like music. I like to listen to music. I like to listen to music, and I like to listen to music. And I like to feel things. I want to feel things. And I am happy to be here. And I am happy to be here. And I am happy because I am happy. And the people here are very happy and I am happy. And I am happy with my life here. And that is all I can say. 
Melanie Harris 
And you were born in Montreal, right?
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
Yeah, I am from Montreal. 
Melanie Harris 
And you were a record store owner?
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
Yes, I was a record store owner. My family is from Quebec. And my mother always had a lot of records. She always had records, and she always had vinyl. And she always had a lot of records. And she always had a record shop. And she would pick up some records, and she would sell them to my friends and to my family. And my family is very close to the Québécois people. And they always make a lot of memories every year. And if you are a musician, you realize that a lot of people love to be musicians. And I want to be like them. 
Melanie Harris 
We just want to hear a bit of a bit of art from you. 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
Yeah, I want to listen to a piece of music, and I want to listen to music. And I want to listen to music, and I want to love music. And I want to be good at music, and I want to be good at everything. 
Melanie Harris 
I guess it is a pretty unique thing to have an international audience, because you don’t need to worry about having some sort of observer panel. 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
I guess that is what it means to be a musician, because I was a musician, I was a musician. I was in my studio early in the morning, and I would make music, and I would do music. And I was a musician. I loved music. I loved my family. I love my friends, and I love to be creative. I mean, I have my own ideas, and I love to do stuff. And I want to do stuff, and I want to know what to do. And I want to know what to do
====================
The latest update is here, and the previous update was here. 
I think this is the most musically important release of the year up to this point. I think this is the one. 
It has a lot to say about the integrity of what we do and how we work. I think we’re going to see a lot of people trying to imitate what we do, but we don’t care. We do care about how we work, and we know that you can’t do that if you don’t care about the details. We enjoy the details. We’re not afraid to do it, and we’re not afraid to do it right. Everything is just about the details, and we don’t care about the details, but we’re trying to do it right, and we’re going to see a lot of people trying to do that. 
The other thing that I think, and I think the other thing that people are going to benefit from is the fact that, as a producer, it’s very easy to do a record with a lot of money. I think that’s not true anymore, and it’s a real shame to have to work with a record company that will only spend money on the first or the first single. I think that’s to be avoided, because if you want to do a record with lots of money, if your first single is not big, then the rest of the records you’re going to do is going to be big. You want to do a record with lots of money, and that’s what I think is on my radar. We want to do a record that’s dope, that’s good, and that’s your home. 
Audience Member 
Hi, I was wondering if you can answer a couple of questions. 
Audience member 
I’m sorry? 
Audience member 
I guess, you have a pretty large collection of music, to be honest with you. 
Audience member 
I think I can tell you some things about that, because I was listening to a lot of these tracks now, and I can’t tell you if I like them or not, because I’ve never listened to a record that wasn’t good. 
Audience member 
I think you’re right, for sure. 
Audience member 
Yeah, and I think that’s probably the biggest thing. 
Audience member 
I think it’s still important to be careful, but also, I know that you’re very into your music. I have two things that I want to ask you, but I think that’s a really good question. You mentioned that you play a lot of pop, but what kind of pop have you produced? 
Audience member 
I think pop was a bit of an example, because I think we’re talking, I think we’ve done music for many, many years, and I don’t know if it’s more of pop or more of a classic pop record, but like I said, I think pop was a big pop example to me. 
Audience member 
Yeah, and I think that’s what you meant, because I think you said earlier that you’re not afraid to do something bold. I’ve been listening to a lot of the heavy metal, like Dream Theater, and you know what I mean? I think that’s what I’m talking about. 
Audience member 
Yeah, and that is the thing that I think people should do, I think they should… I think I could say this is like the next step in pop, and I think it’s a very different thing than what people are talking about now. I think it’s very different, and I think it’s a good thing. I think people should do what they feel, and that’s what I’ve been doing, I do what I feel. 
Audience member 
Yeah, absolutely. 
Audience member 
Thank you. 
Audience member 
I think that’s exactly what I meant, I think you’ll be around for a long time. 
Audience member 
I’m wondering if you can talk about your musical project, because I think it’s pretty interesting. 
Audience member 
I don’t know, I’m just curious about your music, and my question, and I want to know, about your approach to producing, and about your approach to producing now. I’ve heard a lot about you, and I want to know about

Putting on a show for the drummer, which is where he’s at now. I think he is a little bit more relaxed. I think he got to a point where he can make his tunes with a team of people.
Todd L. Burns
You have to think, “What’s the difference between a band and a band of people?”
Gregorio De Passe 
There’s no difference. There’s no difference. There’s no difference. I think it’s important to have a certain level of professionalism and to be professional. It’s one of the things I like about the band. It’s a band of people that’s going to just take it to the media and say, “We’re a band of musicians, is this a real band?” And then you have to be the judge. It’s a band. This is a band of musicians. This is a band of musicians. Now, there’s a lot of people who are not musicians that I know of. I think the irony is that I said, “I’m in love with a band of musicians.” I mean, the band of musicians that I know of, they’re a band of musicians, the drummer and the singer, they’re not musicians. They’re musicians. They’re musicians, they know what they want to do. I think it’s important to have a certain level of professionalism, the knowledge that you have, the credentials of the band that you’re representing. I think the only difference between a band and a band of people is that the band of musicians is there to support the drummer, they’re there to support the singer, and they’re there to support the drummer. I think this is the difference between a band and a band of people, is that the band of musicians is there to support the drummer and the singer. I think that’s the difference.
Todd L. Burns
No one is saying that’s the same.
Gregorio De Passe 
No. No. No, not that it’s the same. The difference is that the band is the band, the band of musicians is the band of musicians. It’s a band of musicians that are going to take it to the media and say, “We’re a band of musicians.” They know what they want to do, they know what they’re talking about, they know what they are doing. I think that’s the difference. I think that’s the difference.


It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when Gregor F. Martin left the technical stage to become a full-fledged songwriter. But through it all, he’s remained a part of the club scene.
Martin is the founder of the electronic music label, Pitbull, and he’s been a fixture at the Gold Club and in dance music arenas around the world.
In this lecture at the 2008 Red Bull Music Academy, Martin talked about the creative process, recording techniques, and how he made music.
Todd L. Burns
This is the first time ever in what’s called the Red Bull Music Academy that we’re going to be coming on the stage where we’ve heard from somebody who’s been on the road for a decade, and everybody’s going to be listening to your music.
(music: Pitbull – “The Power (Pitbull Mix)” / applause)
Todd L. Burns
There’s that.
Gregor F. Martin 
Thank you.
Todd L. Burns
You’re sitting in here, you’re a real house DJ.
Gregor F. Martin 
Yeah, you know what I mean.
Todd L. Burns
What was it like to be in the club in the ‘80s?
Gregor F. Martin 
It was a great experience. I remember coming into the club in New York, there was a big new sound system in the club. I had a Kraftwerk thing, and it was kind of a record. It was a little bit old, but it was nice.
Todd L. Burns
For those who may not know, that was a big part of the Pitbull sound.
“The Power” was your first song, you did a lot of Pitbull hits, the sound of that was pretty amazing.
Gregor F. Martin 
Yeah, it was fun.
Todd L. Burns
What was it like to be in the club in the ‘80s?
Gregor F. Martin 
It was great. I got a new sound system. It was

"Somebody has to be in charge of the shit. You got to grab it and you got to go in there and make it happen. I mean, that was what was going on with us, and we were there in the back. We didn't have a lot of money, but we just tried to make it happen. People knew we was there, but they didn't know we was the only thing they had. We had to take it out. They didn't want to pay for it. They didn't want to pay for the police or whatever it was they were doing. We didn't want the police to come in. The police never came in and they never even looked at us. They never looked at us, they never got in the door. We didn't want no police, they just went and did their job. They never even looked at us. We just went in the back, we just played our music, and they didn't even have to bother us. They just did their job. The police never even came in, they only did their job when we said we were there. They just took it out. It was like that for a long time. They never even got in the door. Hell, they even took it out of us, and we just stopped doing music. We didn't want to do it. They didn't want to put a police officer in our house. All we wanted to do was just play, we just didn't want to be a rock band. We just wanted to play our music. We didn't want nobody to be in our house, we just wanted to play our music. 
I mean, we was playing our music, and we was showing them, we was just playing it, and we was giving them a tour, and they was just going to do their job. They never even bothered us, and they just took it out of us. We just stopped doing music. We just stopped playing. We just stopped doing it. I mean, they were doing their job, but they just didn't want to make it a big deal. They just wanted to do their job. We just didn't want to be talked about as a rock band and they just didn't want to do it. They just wanted to do their job. They never even bothered us. We just didn't want to be talked about as a rock band, and we just didn't want to be talked about as a rock band. We just wanted to be playing our music. We just didn't want to be talked about as a rock band, and we just didn't want to be talked about as a rock band. We just wanted to do our job. They just didn't want to do it, and we just didn't want to be talked about as a rock band, and we just didn't want to be talked about as a rock band.

Jeff “Chairman” Mao     
I mean, we were just playing music, and we were just showing them, and we were just playing at the time, and they were just showing them all the different ways to use technology, and they were just showing it all, and we just made it happen. We just went in there and we just did what we did. We just kept doing it. We just did it. We just did it and we just kept doing it. When people ask, they ask for the truth, and we just kept doing it. We just kept doing it, and we just kept doing it.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao    
Is it just the beat-and-bust system, or do you play the songs live? 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao    
The beat-and-bust system, and we just had to do it. It was a little simpler than the rhythm-and-tango system. It was just a little more structure-based, and it was just a little smoother. You just got to keep playing the songs. Just keep playing the songs. It was just a little bit more like '70s rock, and it was like that for a long time. I mean, we had a little more structure-based, and it was just a little more faster, and it was just a little more sophisticated. We just played it, and it just kept changing. I mean, we tried to do it, and we just kept doing it. The rhythm-and-tango system, we just had to do it. That wasn't a problem. That wasn't a problem, because we just went in there and just played it. 
Audience Member    
I think that is a huge difference. I mean, you’re playing almost a lot of different styles, because you have a drummer, you have a bassline, you have a snare, you have your keyboards, you
====================
When your music’s released, you can’t replace it, you have to get it out. So, when you’re working on something new, but you’re working on a record that’s going to be out in October, you have to get it out in November. 
I’m always working on a record that I know I can do, so I don’t feel like I’m getting too old. When the record comes out, I’m like, “Oh my god, I’m old.” 
But you can’t just turn around and say, “Oh, I think I can do this record.” I don’t want to be the guy that’s like, “I feel like I can do this record, I can do it.” I want to be like, “Oh my god, I want to do it.” I want to be ready to go. 
If you don’t feel like you have something that you want to do, then it’s not going to be a good record. If you feel like you’re doing it, then you’re going to be successful. But if you’re not working on a record that’s going to be out in October, then you’re going to be disappointed. 
I have a lot of friends that are musicians that are just working on records. The first record I ever did was a record that was really good. I had worked with other musicians on a record. There was a record that was really good by a guy named DJ Can, and he was working on a record for a club called The Palace. He was putting me in a room with his bass and his drum set, and I just started doing this jazz record. That was the first record that I did. The last record I did was a record that I did for a club called The Palace. 
It was just the first record I did for a club. I just started doing it. I do sometimes other records for other people, but I just start doing it, and I just do it. I think my record was good, and I just kept doing it. I just kept working on it. Then I started doing it for a little bit. I just started doing it for a little bit. A lot of people have a lot of problems with the label, but I just started doing it. I just did a record with DJ Can called “The Battle of the Bases.” 
The last record I have, I just finished posting on my blog, and that is going to be out on my own label, and I just recorded the album a little bit better than I did the first record. I just wanted to have a record that was going to be out this year. It wasn’t just a record. I wanted to have a record that was going to be out in October, and I just didn’t want to do a record that was out in November. I just wanted to just do a record. I would make a record and go into the studio and just go in and just do it. I just wanted to do a record that was going to be out this year, and I just didn’t want to do a record that was going to be out in December. I just never had a reason to do a record. I just done it. 
JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO
One of the things that is really special about the way you work, is that you’re very selective about what you do. Do you always work with a producer that you know you can trust, or do you work with someone who you think would do a better job? 
Tiga
I try to work with producers who I know can work with me, or I don’t want to work with producers that I don’t want to work with, because it’s a lot of work to work with them. I try to work with producers that I know can work with me, because if I work with one, it’s going to be cut off from them. 
JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO
So, you were just talking about a lot of different people on this record, and you’re working with a lot of different people. 
Tiga
Yeah, I’ve done some different things over the years. I think I’ve worked with a producer that I know I can trust, and I’ve worked with other producers, but I’ve never worked with a producer that I know I can trust, and I’ve never worked with a producer that I know I can trust.

Texas Rangers and Detroit Tigers
This is how the song came about:
(music: Detroit Tigers – “War Pigs” / applause)
That was “War Pigs” by Detroit Tigers.
(music: Detroit Tigers – “War Pigs”) 
Here we go, they just stuck a record on your stereo and you can just hear the drums and the bassline and you can just hear the guitar and the guitar – it’s just a perfect arrangement.
Symon
I remember the song was so popular they put a record on it.
Ricardo
They put a record on the radio.
Ricardo
Yeah, that was the album.
Mike
It was called “War Pigs”.
Ricardo
War Pigs, in the wrong words, it means war, and they just put a record on it.
Mike 
That was a collaboration. That was a collaboration, and that was a collaboration, and that was a collaboration.
Ricardo
Yeah, that was my first record, “War Pigs” was a collaboration. They put a record on it and they just put it out.
Mike
A lot of people who won't know knew, but you can still be there for the whole album.
Ricardo
Yeah, I mean, that’s how I got into the music business, it just started. I was a DJ in Detroit, I was a DJ in Detroit. I was a part of the Detroit Boys, and that was my first album. I mean, I’m from Detroit, I’m from Allentown, Pennsylvania. I grew up in Allentown, so I was kind of an all-around good kid, you know?
Mike
Yeah, and there’s a lot of people who don’t know that, but you grew up in Detroit, and you knew what you were doing, and you knew what you wanted to do in life.
Ricardo
Yeah, the Detroit Boys, they had a big record out with a lot of songs on it. There was a lot of songs on that record. The first thing I said to the producer was, “This is the record you want to do,” and he said, “No, no, no, no, no.” I said, “No, no, no, no, no, no.” I was such a good kid, I let my parents know I wanted to be a DJ and I would do that, and it was just like a big record, and I was just like, “Man, I’m going to do this,” and I was just going to do it.
(music: Detroit Boys – “War Pigs” / applause)
Mike 
Is it interesting to hear you say this record was your first release, because you’ve played with some of the most legendary musical groups in Detroit.
Ricardo
Yeah, it was just the Detroit boys, I was a DJ in Detroit. I was a part of the Detroit Boys, and that was my first release. I was a part of the Detroit Boys, and that was my first record, and I was always in the studio, and I would do that. I would practice, and I would practice, and I would practice, and I would practice, and I would practice, and I would practice, and I would practice, and I would practice, and I would practice.
Mike 
You mentioned that, when you were a kid, you didn’t have any money, and you had to go to school and work as a DJ at age 13, and maybe you could tell us a little bit about that.
Ricardo 
I was 13 years old, and I was a DJ, and I just had to work and work, and I just needed the money to get my car fixed, and my car was repossessed, and I had to go to school and get my car fixed, and I just wanted to be a DJ, and I wanted to be a DJ. I didn’t have any money, and I didn’t have to go to school. I just needed the money, and it was just an easy way to get money.
Mike 
You mentioned it was a part of the Detroit Boys, and this is how that happened.
Ricardo
Yeah, I was a part of the Detroit Boys, and I was a DJ, and I was a part of the Detroit Boys. It wasn’t easy to get money, but it was something I could do. When I was 14 years old, I just had to work, and I was a DJ. It was just a way to make money, and that was how it all started.
Mike 
Did you have any money when you

“I’m not a great dancer, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
A friend of mine. He was a grad student at the time, and he was doing a dance in a club. He was like, “Come on, you good?” And I was like, “Yeah, I’m not doing well.” And he was like, “You know what? You know what? You have what you want to do.” And I was like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.”
The path was there, but I’m like I had already, and then I did my dance and then eight months later I got a little bit of money, so I fell in love with it. And then I did this album, and I was like, “Okay, I’m going to do another album, because I’m not really a big fan of the dance.” I’m not really a big fan of the dance. It’s too fast. It’s too fast, and it’s not true to the music. 
And I’m in love with the music. I’m in love with it, and I’m going to do another album, because it’s really not the same as the first album. I’m going to do another album, because I’m not going to do any dance music. I’m going to do another album, because I’m not going to do dance music. I’m going to do some hip-hop dance, because I feel like hip-hop music is just a little bit too old fashioned, just a little bit too old school. I feel like hip-hop music has too much of an attitude that it has. It’s too old-fashioned, and it’s just not the like the music I love. I’m going to do another album, because I’m like, my main thing is I don’t care about what you dance to. I’m going to do what I love. I’m going to do what I love. I’m going to do what I love. I’m going to do what I love.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
That was a great question.
A friend of mine who’s a DJ friend of yours, and he has a dance album. And then he did a remix of one of my dance songs, which was an album called “MIDNIGHT RIDE.” And he did that track, and then I did a remix of “MIDNIGHT RIDE.” And then I did a remix of “MIDNIGHT RIDE.” And then I did remixes of everybody. I’ll say “Love Train” by Billie Holiday, “If I Ain’t You.” Love Train by Billie Holiday, “The Gold Digger.” I did that, because I love that track. I love it. A lot of people, when they hear that song, they’ll be like, “Wow,” and they don’t know what to make of it. But what I made it, I made it “amazing.” I made it “amazing.” And that was the thing that I needed to do if I wanted to be great, if I want to do something with great talent, I know I’m going to be able to do it. I’m going to be able to do it. If you want to be great at it, you have to have the talent. I had a lot of talent up there, but I’m still not there yet, and I’m not going to be able to do it. And it’s not just the DJ talent, it’s the dancers in the club, and it’s the producers, as well. The producers, they’re going to be able to make me better, so I’ll be able to do it, because I’ve got the talent.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Do you have any questions for the interviewer?
Audience Member    
Hi, I’m a DJ from New York. I’ve just started doing music, and I have a great influence on people, including myself. I work in a club called the Slits, and I do a lot of dancehall, both live and on the radio, but I’m also a producer, and I’m also a DJ. Do you want to talk about how you experience the music?

"Do you have a copy of the Record of a Day?
Brian Fallon 
No, but I’ll give you a copy if you want.
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt 
I’ve got one, but I’m very proud of it because it’s so political.
Brian Fallon 
I mean, there’s a lot of things that I’ve hated. But I don’t feel like we’re going to get to that point. I feel like we’re going to get to that point. And I think something that’s important to me is that it’s being done by people who are not political. It’s being done by people who don’t feel like they’re being watched. And I think that’s important.
I don’t feel like we’re going to get to the point where we’re listening to what you’re saying. And I think that’s important. And I think that people are going to get to the point where they’re going to like it. And that’s what I want to do. I want to make it bigger than that. Because, you know, it’s been a long time ago, but, you know, I’m doing it now.
And I think that’s the most important. I want to make it bigger than that.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao 
You mentioned that you’re not a politician.
Brian Fallon 
I’m not a politician. I’m not to be trusted with power. I’m not to be trusted with money. I’m not to be trusted with anything. I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to be the guy who watches over people and gives people advice and says, “You know, I don’t want to be here,” or whatever someone is saying.” I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to be the guy who says, “You know, you know, you’re good,” or whatever. I’m not going to do that.
And I’m not going to be the guy who’s like, “Hey, you know, we should do this.” I’m not going to be that guy. I’m not going to be that guy. I’m not going to be that guy. I’m not going to be that guy.
But this song is about the right. And if you know what I mean, it’s about the right. And if you know what I mean, it’s about the right. And if you know what I mean, it’s about the right. And if you know what I mean, you’ve got a lot of people out there who are going to be listening to it. You know what I mean?
Why not do it? Because, the other thing I’ve said is, “Look, I’m not going to be here,” because I’ve got a lot of people I’ve worked with. I’ve worked with some great people, I’ve worked with some great people. So, I’m not going to be here. I don’t want to be here, and I’m not going to be there for them. And I’m not going to be the guy who’s like, “Hey, you know, you got this album out there, you shouldn’t be here.” I’m not going to be that guy. I’m not going to be that guy.
I’m not going to be that guy. I’m not going to be that guy. I’m going to be the person who’s going to be great, and who’s going to be great, and who’s going to be great, and I’m going to be great, and I’m going to be great, and I’m going to be great. And I’m going to be great.
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt 
As you said a lot of people have heard, there’s a lot of people in the world who love you.
Brian Fallon 
I’ve got people from the world of music, and I’ve got people from the world of politics. I’ve got people from the world of religion. I

Tammy Ann 
We always say, we don’t want to be a mom. We don’t want to be a mother. We want to be the best mother ever. We want to be the best mother ever. We just want to be the best mother ever.
I just want to be a mom, I just want to do this. I’m going to do this for you. If you’re asking me about my mother, I’m going to be your mom, I’m going to be your mom. If you’re asking me about my father, I’m going to be your father. I’m going to be your father. We’re going to be the best mother ever.

====================
When he was talking about people, he would sometimes say to me, “You know you’re working at a very high level.” I always thought he meant that he understood that I had a lot of talent. He would say to me, “Look, you’ll be the best DJ on the planet,” but he would always work me down and then you’d get your work and then someone else would do it. So I would always work him down and then he would do it.
Audience Member    
What did you think of that when you saw him do it?
Floyd Mayweather
When he did the first film, he was into it. I didn’t know what to expect from him. I didn’t know what he meant when he said he wanted to make movies about people. I knew that he wanted to do a film about people, but I didn’t know why. I don’t know if he meant that he wanted to make a film about people. I didn’t know about the stories. I didn’t know what people had to say about it. I didn’t know what things he was doing at the time. I didn’t know if he was doing it for the money or what he was doing for the people. I think it was it for the people. I didn’t know about the people. I was working at a similar position to him, but he was going to do it for the people. I was working at a job and I wasn’t working at a job.
Audience Member   
Are you still working?
Floyd Mayweather 
I am. I work in the kitchen and I work in the kitchen and I do everything, but I’m still working. I’m still getting my food and I’m still eating, but I am still working. It’s like that for me, “I want to make movies about people,” but I don’t want to do movies about people. I want to make movies about music and I want to do movies about music.
Audience Member   
You mentioned earlier, I wanted to ask you about your relationship with music, but I was also talking with the director of the film about you being in the kitchen and you were talking about what you felt, what you ate, and what music you listen to. Was there any time that you had to go to the bathroom?
Floyd Mayweather 
No. I was in the kitchen, but it was a big time. I was working at a job. I was working at a job. So I had to think, “How am I going to make this movie,” and when I was working at the restaurant and I was working in the kitchen, I was working in the kitchen and when I was working in the kitchen, I had to think about my family. I had to think about how to feed the kids, but when I was working in the kitchen, I had to think about my family. I had to think about how I was going to feed my family and how I was going to feed my kids.
I was working at a job, but I was working at a job and I was working at a job. That’s what I am, I am working at a job. I am at a job and I am working at a job.
And I just have this feeling that I am doing what they are expecting of me. I don’t know what they’re expecting of me, or I don’t know what I am doing. I just know that I am doing what they are expecting of me and I want to do it. I’m doing what I should be doing.
Audience Member    
When you talk with people about it, they say, “You need a job and you need to eat.” I thought, “That’s how you get good at it.” I think that was the main thing. I don’t know what the job is but I do know that I am doing it. I think it’s very important for people to understand that I just want to do it, but I don’t want to go to the bathroom. It is like I’m not doing it enough. I don’t want to do it.
I’m like you said, I’m still working at this job and I’m still eating. I want to do it, I want to do it. I want to get my food, I want to get my coffee, I want to get my snacks, I want to do my homework. I want to go to the gym, I want to go to the movies, I want to go to
