So, when you hear the name of the person who did this song you think is the biggest artist in Hip-Hop, that's a pretty big announcement. That you’re going to have a hit record, that you’re going to release the record, that you’re going to get a Grammy, that you’re going to be on the radio, that you’re going to be a star, that you’re going to be a world star, that you’re going to go to the top of the charts, that you’re going to be a star in your country, that you’re going to be on MTV, that you’re going to be on the radio, that you’re going to come out on the charts, that you’re going to be a star. What do you think?
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt   
I think it’s pretty clear that I don’t like the way the record has been received. The song is going to be a hit record, it’s not going to be a deal break, it’s going to be a deal break, it’s going to be a deal break, it’s going to be a deal break, it’s going to be a deal break. That’s a deal break. That doesn’t mean you’re going to go to the top of the charts, that you’re going to be in the charts, that you’re going to be on MTV, that you’re going to be on the radio, that you’re going to be a star, that you can be nominated, that you can be nominated. That doesn’t mean you’re going to go to the top of the charts. That doesn’t mean you’re going to be the big artist. That doesn’t mean you’re going to be on the radio, that doesn’t mean you’re going to be on the radio. That doesn’t mean you’re going to be able to get a Grammy. That doesn’t mean you’re going to be on tour, that doesn't mean you’re going to be on the radio, that doesn’t mean you’re going to be on MTV, that doesn’t mean you’re going to be on the radio. That doesn’t mean you’re going to come out on the charts, that doesn’t mean you’re going to be on the radio. That doesn’t mean you’re going to be in the charts, that doesn’t mean you’re going to be on MTV, that doesn’t mean you’re going to be on the radio. That’s a deal break. That’s a deal break, you know? I think that’s what the record is about, I think that they understand. I don’t think that they understand, but the music industry does.
Audience Member 
Do you still feel that the music industry is not buying what you put out?
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt 
No, I don’t think so. I believe that the music industry is going to change very soon, but I don’t think that it’s going to be the music industry that’s changing, but more people getting involved, more people buying records, I don’t believe that the music industry is going to change, it’s going to be more people, more people who will buy records. It’s not going to change, it’s going to be more people. I think that the record industry is going to change, it’s going to change, it’s going to be like it was. I think that’s the record industry, I think that’s what it’s about. I think that’s what they’re going to change, because I think that’s what I’m going to change, because I think that’s what’s going to change. I think the record industry is changing, more people are buying and more people are buying. I think that’s what I’m going to change, because I don’t think there’s gonna be a record industry change that’s going to be bigger than the record industry change that they’re going to change. I don’t think it’s going to be bigger than what I’ve changed. I don’t think I’ve changed how the record industry is changing,

====================
We are a very diverse group of people. We have our own team of writers, we have our own music, we have our own artists. We have our own TV show, we have our own record label, we have our own radio station, we have our own label, we have our own website, we have our own events, we have our own music, we have our own movies.
But we are the only band in the world that... We can say that in this world that people have heard, we can say that our music is very popular and we are very popular. And that is the reason why this record label, we can say that we are the only band, I have recorded in the world, that you can say that in the world that people have heard, we can say that our music is very popular. And that is the reason why they are listening to us, because they want something similar to what they have heard. And that is the reason why we have made this record label, because we want people to feel similar to what they have heard.
And that is what we want to do. But at the same time, there is a lot of things that are happening. In February, there are... In the first week of March, there is a record release for the first album of the year, which is really good. But in the second week, there is a record release for the first album of the year. And in the third week, there is a record release for the first album of the year. I am very happy with the record, but it is very difficult for me to say, because I am always working on new music. I am always looking for new stuff. I am always trying to make new music. And I am always listening to new music.
But at the same time, I love to do, I am always trying to make new music. And I want to do it better than this. I want to do it better than the record that I released last year that was more popular than this record that I released, which was very popular. But I always try to do new music, because it is the only time I have. And I want to do it better than my last record.

By the time you’ll be 25 your career as a songwriter is over. Even if you find a home and a career making your own music, that’s it. It’s just not there yet, it’s just a very limited idea. It’s a stab at it, and you can have a few songs that you do and a couple of songs that you don’t, but it’s not there yet. But when you’re 25 you don’t know what you’re doing, you don’t know what you’re doing, you don’t know how to present the music, you don’t know what you’re doing, you don’t know who you are, you don’t know what you’re talking about, but you’re just going to be the guy who makes music.

Your first album will be which song you wrote. Maybe you’ll write a song you thought would be good, but then if you want to, you could go on and do the next song. You have to make sure that you know who you are, you know what you want to do, you know where you want to go, you know your goals, you know how you’re going to accomplish them, and you know how long you can’t do them. You know what you’ve been doing, you know where you
====================
The first one I ever saw was the original Radiohead record,
and a lot of people said, “Hey, you know what? You can’t do that.” I had heard it,
and I still had it. I was like, “Look, if you can do it, you can do it,” and I did. It wasn’t the same
one, but it was a similar tone and I thought, “Well, you know what?” I think I did
enough to have the record. I had enough money and I didn’t need to change,
but I had a feeling that I could do it, so I did.
Audience Member 
I guess ‘The Bends’ is the one that really put it in perspective, that you, as a young man,
didn’t even know if you could do it.
Adam Goodes 
Yeah, it was like, “Man, I don’t want to do it. I don’t want to be in a band, I don’t wanna take this
job, I don’t want to do it.” I didn’t want to be in a band, I wanted to be
just a DJ and it was not going to get any better than that. I thought, “I’m just gonna
just do it and then I’m out of here.” I think I was a great DJ, but I wanted to do it, so I did. I didn’t want to be in a band and be an MC, so I
did.
Audience Member 
I think that was after you had been on the road for a long time and you had done
it enough, you were able to get a job, which was something that you could only do if you worked in
the same place, and you had a good record company. What was the first job you got at
the end of your career at the end of 2003?
Adam Goodes 
I used to work in a coffee shop and I remember that I worked at Starbucks and I was working with a guy called DJ Kode9. It was like a big trick. I was working in a coffee shop at the time, and it was like, “Man, this is the time.” I knew something was happening, and if I worked my way through the coffee shop I was going to get a job. If I worked my way through the coffee shop and the manager, I was going to get a job. I was in the coffee shop and I was working with DJ Kode9 and I was working on some stuff, and I was a DJ and I was doing it for a long time. I was in the coffee shop in LA and then I was in New York. I was a DJ at the same time. I had no problem working in a coffee shop, but I was still in the coffee shop and I was still working with DJ Kode9. That was the first job I got, and I worked in a coffee shop. I was a DJ, but I felt I was just going to be doing it for a long time. I was a DJ and I was doing it for a long time.
Audience Member 
You were working at Starbucks, weren’t you?
Adam Goodes 
Yeah, I was a DJ in Starbucks. I was a DJ, but I was doing it for a long time, and I just knew if I worked my way through the coffee shop, they’d get a job. If I worked my way through the coffee shop, they would find a job. They didn’t have to hire me to do something, they just would. You know what I mean? They would go upstairs and they would talk to the manager, and they would find a job and they would get a job. I didn’t know if I could do it, and I didn’t know if I could do it, but I thought I could do it. I kind of knew what I could do and I knew where I was going, but it was a long time. I don’t know, I think I was doing it for a while. I would think I could do it, but I was still in the coffee shop and I was still working with DJ Kode9. I was DJing for a long time and I was still making music, but I was still DJing in the coffee shop.
Audience Member 
Who is DJing for us?
Adam Goodes 
I don’t know, I don’t know. I guess I am DJing for myself, but I don’t know what I’m doing in LA right now. I don’t know. It is just a
====================
The world of the concert hall is a huge, diverse place. It’s got a lot to do with the fact that it’s a musical society, and with a lot of different people coming from different backgrounds, it’s a very, very diverse place. Because the people who are born in the United States in the 1980s, these are people who’ve got a lot in common with each other, their music is very diverse, and they’re probably not going to be like the typical British or American audience. So it’s a very diverse audience, and they have different tastes and different tastes, and they’re not like the typical British or American audience, and that’s what makes it so special. 
I think the strangest thing to me is, I think the people who really like to hear music … The thing that I want to take back is that I think the people who like to hear music are not necessarily the people who like to be in a club, they may not be the people who are playing a lot of music, they may not be the people who try to get into the music business, they may not be the people who are going to buy records, they may not be the people who are really into music at all, they may not like to change their cultural background, they may not want to be in a club, they may not want to do things that are out of the box, they may not want to do things that are in their comfort zone, they may not want to change who they are, it’s a very diverse audience, and they’re all different. 
So it’s a very, very diverse audience, and the people who are into music are not necessarily the people who are going to go to a club, they might not want to do something out of the box, they might not want to try something out of the box, they might not like to do things that are out of the box, they’ll be the people who can get into the music industry, and they’re all in the same boat here, and they’re all going to be in the same boat as the people who are into music. 
Benji B 
We have a couple of other people who are really into music, and we’re talking about producers, record label owners, artists, musicians. I mean, you’re talking about people who are in the same boat as you, in the same boat as you. 
Ross Andru 
Exactly, and we talk about the same things. I met a guy, he’s a producer, he’s been on a label for seven or eight years, and he just happened to be in the same boat, and I’ve been a DJ and a producer, and he’s going to be in the same boat. 
Benji B 
What do you think is the biggest misconception about the DJ and how things work in this area of the business
at the moment, or what is the biggest misconception? 
Ross Andru    
The biggest misconception is you get a lot of people who just want to be in this club, and they’ll go into this club, and they’ll do a lot of things off the club, and they’ll do a lot of things, and they’ll have a lot of ideas, and they’ll do a lot of different things. But the biggest misconception is that you’re not going to make money, you’re not going to have a record deal, you’re not going to be selling records, you’re not going to get a label, you’re not going to get a record deal, you’re not going to be a DJ, you’re not going to be a producer, you’re not going to be a DJ, you’re not going to be a record company, you’re not going to be a producer, you’re not going to get a record deal, you’re not going to be a record company, you’re not going to get a record deal, and you’re not going to be working in the industry, it’s just not going to happen. 
Benji B    
And what do you think is the biggest misconception about the DJ and how things work in this area of the business at the moment? 
Ross Andru    
The biggest misconception is that it’s going to make you rich, it’s not going to make you rich, it’s more about the amount of money you can make, not about the amount of money you’ll make, it’s about what you can do, and what you can do

If you’re a producer or a DJ, do you think it was worth it to have Aloe Blacc in a band?
I don’t think so, it was a bad name, but I’m a DJ, and Aloe Blacc was an early DJ, and you’re a producer, how do you balance? I think it was worth it to have Aloe Blacc in a band, because in a club, it wasn’t like something you could do, and then have a record label that you could do. 
All you had to do was buy the record, and you could do it yourself. Aloe Blacc was very up and coming, but they were a very vocal group, and I think that was a big part of what made Aloe Blacc special, was that Aloe Blacc was very upfront about their music, and they were getting ready to try it out, and they would do some covers, and they would do their own version of it. I think that was very important. 
I think that was important, that Aloe Blacc was a band that was very upfront about what they wanted to do, and they were trying it, and they were making it happen. But you could do the same thing, but it was different, and I think it was worth it to have Aloe Blacc in a band, because Aloe Blacc would have their own shows, and they would sell out shows, and it was a very good thing to have them in a band. 
It was only when they were working with other DJs that they were open to doing things, and they were ready to try it out, and I think that was really important, to have them in a band. 
I think that’s why Aloe Blacc’s house music became so popular, because they were open to doing it, and as a DJ, it just makes the whole scene, because they were open to doing it, and they were willing to do it. 
Also, it became very popular in the house music scene, because when you saw them play, you could tell that they put their heart and soul into it. And I think that’s a really important part, of having a band that you can listen to, because you’re just going to listen to it, and you’ll get into the whole groove of it. 
You could hear the early cuts, and they were always up to date, and you’d know what was coming later, and it’d be a good time to be in a club, because it was a good time to be in a house party, because it was a good time to be in a house party. 
I think that’s really how it spread, because if you had a house, and you had a DJ that was open to doing it, you could just go to a house party, and it was a good time to be in a house. 
That’s why Aloe Blacc became popular, because it was very open and spontaneous, and the whole thing was about getting different people together. You wanted to do a cover of Aloe Blacc, and you wanted to do a cover of Aloe Blacc. If you had a house, you would have a house party, and it would be about the music, it would be about the music, and it would be about the house. 
But if you had a house, you would have a house party, and it would be about the house, and you would play the house music, and you would play the house music. And it was about the house, and it was about dance music. 
That’s what it was about. That was always the point, and I think that was the point, when Aloe Blacc first arrived, it was about house music. 
It was about house music, and it was about house music in general. 
Adam Bainbridge 
With Aloe Blacc, I mean, you saw them in clubs, and they were playing house music, and it was pretty funny because you wouldn’t know who was going to be in the house. 
I remember playing Aloe Blacc, and at that time, back in ’86, they were playing house music, and they were having a lot of fun, and you could see people dance, and they were dancing, and they had the house beat, and they had the house bass, and they had the house beats, and they were playing house music. And that was their thing, and it was a lot of fun. 
I remember Aloe Blacc
====================
The '80s were some of the most crazy years of my life. I was a teenager and I didn’t really have a lot of money, but you had to hustle to get a car and to get a little bit of money to buy a car, and a lot of people wanted you to do all these crazy things. I thought, “This is bullshit.” But I had a lot of friends that wanted me to do all this crazy stuff, and I thought, “Well, I can’t do this.” Then I tried it and I did it, and I just started making music. Just like everybody else, I wanted to do this. I was only 16, 17, 18 at the time. I was in my house and I was making music all the time.
I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I had a lot of people that wanted me to do this stuff, and I was like, “What are you doing?” They’re like, “Well, it’s not that, you shouldn’t do this.” I was like, “Well, why would you want to do this? You should just stop.” 
I’m like, “Oh well, we just have to do it.” I just started doing what I wanted to do. I really didn’t have any money, but I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I didn’t have nothing else to do. I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I just wanted to be in the studio and just do what I wanted to do. I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I just wanted to do what I wanted to do.
I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. 
JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO
Was it hard work?
Mark Ronson 
No. I mean, it’s hard work. I mean, it’s hard work, but what was bad about it was that I was still working on music. I was working in the house and I was playing music, and I was just trying to do what I wanted to do. When I was 16 or 17, I think I just had kicked it. I was having fun. I wanted to do what I wanted to do and be in the studio and just do what I wanted to do. I just wanted to be in the studio and just just do what I wanted to do.
JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO
Why didn’t you just have a band?
Mark Ronson 
Because they’d be in the studio, you know what I’m saying? They’d be in the studio, and I would just be like, “What do they want?” They’d be in the studio, and I’d be like, “Well, they’re in the studio.” Then, they’d go and do their thing, and then I’d go and do my thing, and then they’d come back and do their thing. They’d be in the studio playing music, and then they’ll be out of the studio and I’d be like, “Well, that was cool. That was nice.” 
They’d be in the studio playing my stuff, and I’d be like, “Oh, it was cool.” I’d just be like, “Oh, damn.” 
But then I get to the studio, and I’m like, “Oh, shit.” I’m like, “Damn, what’s the matter?” They’re like, “Well, we just want to do our thing with the band.” I was like, “Oh, shit.” 
So, then they did their thing, and then when I got home, I was like, “Oh! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit. Shit! Shit, shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit, shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit. shit.
They did a record, they did a record, they did a record. I don’t want to be on the radio all the time, and I want to be on the radio,
====================
So, I think the first thing you’ll notice about it is that there’s no real sample. There’s just a bunch of samples, and there’s nothing to really latch onto like, “Oh, I can do that.” It’s just a bunch of people playing stuff, and there’s no real, “Oh, I can do that, that’s cool, that’s a sample,” or whatever. You’re talking about a big sample, and there’s no real structure to it.
This is a very simple sample, actually. So, after you hear it and then you can understand it, and then you’ll go, “Okay, that’s cool, that’s interesting.” 
But that’s not the end of it. 
I think the reason why it’s such a good sample is we actually take all of these samples, and we’re just making them up. We don’t even take the original sample of the track, “I can do that, that’s awesome.” We just use the sample, but it’s just a bunch of random, “I can do that,” and we just tell the artists what to do with it, and then we just play the sample in and play it, and then we just mix it, and then we just put it out. I just hope that’s true, and I hope that’s true.
Todd L. Burns
So, if you’ve listened to “Magna Carta Holy Grail” or a lot of those people, you’ve got a lot of samples from the ‘60s, but you’re not taking any of this stuff? 
Georges Peterson
Well, I know I’m doing it. I think that a lot of people who play samples, I think a lot of them have heard this track and they’ll just quote it, and quote it and they usually do it on one track. I think that’s just because it’s something that’s really good, but it’s just so much more to it than I thought. I just hope that’s true.
Todd L. Burns
What is a sampling a sample? 
Georges Peterson
It’s a sample. It’s a sample. It’s a sample. We’re not taking any of the samples that are in the record, and for me, it’s just a sample. It’s not a sample from an artist, it’s a sample from a record. That’s the biggest thing, it’s the biggest thing that I know of. Anybody who’s going to say that it’s not a sample, it’s just a sample, they’re just taking it out of context, and that’s what it is. It’s just a sample, and it’s based on a track, and a track is based on a sample, and we just want to have a track that is a sample of a track, and that is the most important thing, and that is the one thing that we need, because if you have a track that is a sample of a track, then that track is a sample of a track, and if you don’t own it, then it’s just a sample.
Todd L. Burns
Do you take the sample? 
Georges Peterson
No, we take it off the label. I don’t know if you want to hear it, but it’s the original. It’s a sample, and that has nothing to do with sampling, I don’t take a sample of a track. 
Todd L. Burns
So, you’d take the original, and you’d do the remix and then you’d do the remix? 
Georges Peterson
No, we take it off the label. We take it off the label and then we just do the remix and the remix, but we just do the three versions of it. We just send a re-edit and a re-edits to the artists, and then we just do the re-edits and do the re-edits. That’s what we do, because we’re doing it very raw, and it’s really just about doing it as straight as possible. 
Todd L. Burns
Yeah, and all of that is what you do, you’re just doing it the old fashioned way. 
Georges Peterson
Yeah, I think that’s true. 
====================
A mother and daughter are in trouble, but she has her own vision and she's got her own ideas, and she’s got her own ideas about how to make a living. 
She has a vision, and she’s got her own ideas of who she should be and what she should be doing.
The thing about her is that she’s very intelligent. 
They’re a kind of revolutionaries in that they’re doing it on their own, and they’re doing it in a very different way than they were doing it before. 
They’re not being paid, and they’re not part of a committee, and they’re doing it on their own. That’s the whole point of the record, and that’s what was so important to me, and that’s what I want to celebrate. 
It doesn’t matter who you are, it’s all about who you can be and who you want to be. 
I don’t care who you are, if you want to make a living off of music, or how much money you have or what you can afford, just don’t be afraid to just do it yourself, and just do it in a way that you don’t have to be part of a committee and you don’t have to spend money, and you don’t have to sign a contract and you just do it on your own. 
That’s what I want to show these mothers. If you want to work, if you want to put food on the table, if you want to make a living off your music, just just do it on your own. It’s so easy to be a part of a committee, and then when you put it out there, people are going to be like, “Oh, man.” But that’s how it’s going to be. You just don’t have to be a part of a committee, and you don’t have to sign a contract, but just do it on your own. 
It doesn’t matter who you are, it’s just all about who you can be. So, if you’re an aspiring mother, I mean, you know what I mean? If you’re aspiring, you know what I mean? If you want to be a mother, it’s just about how much you can afford, and how much you can put into the things that you want to have. If you want to be rich, or whatever, don’t be afraid to take that next step, because it’s going to be your own in a way. 
That’s what I want to say, is that if you want to have a happy and healthy family, you need to do it on your own. You know what I mean? If you want to have a lovely home and family, then you just got to do it on your own. 
I don’t know who you are, but this is where I’m at. It’s not about who you are, it’s about who you’re going to be. That’s it. 
I mean, it’s funny, we’ve done a record that has a lot of people replying to it, but it’s a late record, and I have a lot of people thanking me for it, but I don’t know when I’m going to be on the radio again. 
The record does well, and the record does well. But if you want to have a happy and healthy family, then you just got to do it on your own. I’m not going to make a statement about who you are, or tell you who you’re supposed to be, or whatever, but just do it on your own. 
I’m a mother, and I’m a mother to my three children, and I’m going to have a baby in the morning, and I’m going to have a baby in the afternoon, and I’m going to have a baby in the morning and I’m a mother to all of our children. That’s what I’m going to be doing in the morning and I’m going to be doing in the afternoon, just because I’m a mother in this day and age. It’s not about who you are, it’s about who you want to be. 
That’s what I’m going to be doing in the morning and in the afternoon, just because I want to have a happy and healthy family. Each one of us here is a mother, and I�

Turbo
Turbo is a project to put an album out, a record that takes you into the very depths, so you can dive into the abyss, and if you dig, they have a track for you. They’re like ... I don’t know. I think it’s called Lost in the Deep. It’s about, “I know we’re talking about sampling a lot of stuff, but I know there’s more going on than just sampling.” I mean, it’s sampling, but it’s not sampling, and it’s not sampling, it’s just trying to do it in the most authentic way possible. This is a track called “Losing it to the Gods,” it’s like a song that sounds like a modern day drum & bass. It’s just an album, it’s like with Animal Collective, they have a track called “Losing it to the Gods.” I don’t know, it’s like a song that sounds like a modern day drum & bass record. It’s just sampling Animal Collective, it’s just a sample of a track. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
You’re talking about a lot of different people, in terms of sampling techniques. You mentioned MRD, I guess there’s a lot of people out there who, you said in your last message, like when you say the original sample, you said it was from the ’80s. I want to know, do you know what I mean?
Turbo
That’s very accurate. I mean, I do know, I have more than one person who’s a member of the Animal Collective, but it’s not like it’s my sampling or anything. It’s just a sample. It’s like Animal Collective sampled ’80s disco. It’s just a sample, it’s just like Animal Collective sampled ’80s disco. It’s just like Animal Collective sampled ’80s, it’s just like that. It’s just similar. I like the sample, but I have a lot of things to say about it. I have so many issues with it. I have a couple of issues with it, so I’m going to put them out.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
The Animal Collective really had a lot of synth and drum & bass, you said, “I know you all want to hear that, but I’m also a good listener.”
Turbo
I mean, I do know. I mean, there’s a lot of stuff out there, but you know what I mean, I have a lot of people who actually listen to things, and people who don’t. But it’s not like that’s the reason why I like it, it’s just because I like the way that they sound. I just want to hear things that I like, and I want to hear stuff that’s fresh, but I want to hear things that is fresh. And I have to learn how to sample, and I have to learn how to record, and I have to learn how to sample. I have to learn how to take samples and make them sound fresh. I have to put them on their own tracks, because they’re like a sound. It’s just like sampling, it’s just like that. It’s just a sample, it’s just like that. I don’t know, it’s just like that. 
For me, it’s all about that. I don’t know what to think, I’m not so smart as much as I could be. I don’t know what to say. I just want to listen, and I want to listen to everything that has something to say to me. I don’t know, I’m not a sample, I’m not a sampling, I don’t know what to say. I just want to listen to everything, and I want to listen to everything. But I have to learn how to sample, I have to learn how to record, I have to learn how to sample. I have to learn how to mix, I have to mix, and I have to mix. 
I’m going to put out an album that’s going to be like a modern day drum & bass record. It’s going to be like the Animal Collective album, “Losing it to the Gods.” It’s going to be just like the Animal Collective album, “Losing it to the Gods

The Christian Science Monitor
The church that Bishop John Piper would go to, the Episcopal Church, started out as a secular church. It was a place for people to worship, it was not religious in any way. It was for people to get help, not for money. It was for people to pray.
When you go to a hospital, if you have a serious illness, you have to go to the doctor, you have to see your doctor for what you need to do, and you have to pray. If you don’t have money for a doctor, you have to go to a church. If you have a family member who has, “I don’t know how much money I have to give you, but I want to help you,” you have to go to a church. If you don’t have money, you have to go to a hospital. If you have to go to a hospital, you have to pray. We don’t have to worry about our money, we just have to pray.
[applause]
You can’t just be a kid, you have to go to worship. If you don’t have money, you go to the church. You go to a hospital. If you have to go to a hospital, you have to pray. If you don’t have money, you have to pray. You have to go to the doctor. You have to go to a church. If you don’t have money, you go to a hospital. If you have to go to a hospital, you have to pray. If you don’t have money, you go to a church. If you have to go to a church, you have to pray. If you don’t have money, you pray. If you don’t have money, you go to the hospital. If you have to go to a hospital, you pray. If you don’t have money, you pray. If you don’t have money, you go to the hospital. If you don’t have money, you pray.
I think that is what I was talking about, if you want to go to a hospital, you just go to church. You don’t have to worry about money, you just go to the church. If you have money, you go to a hospital. If you have to go to a hospital, you go to a church. If you don’t have money, you go to a church. If you have to go to a hospital, you pray. If you don’t have money, you go to the hospital. If you have to go to a hospital, you pray. If you don’t have money, you go to a church. If you have to go to a church, you pray. If you don’t have money, you go to the hospital. If you have to go to a hospital, you pray. If you don’t have money, you go to the church. If you have to go to a church, you pray. If you don’t have money, you go to the hospital. If you have to go to a hospital, you go to a church. If you don’t have money, you go to a church. If you have to go to a church, you pray. If you don’t have money, you go to the hospital.

====================
I think sometimes, it’s just too easy to draw a line between music and, “Oh, that was just another song and that was just another song,” and having a good record is very important for you, especially when you can’t afford the equipment.
Jamie J
Yeah but, you know, it’s just so easy to draw a line between music and being a record company boss. It’s just so easy to make it seem like everything’s just about money, it’s just about the money. And people will just buy it and sing along to it. And that’s just not the case with music.
Audience member
It’s really important to have a good record, I think. And if you don’t have a good record, you’re not going to have a good career. You’re not going to have a good name. It’s just not going to be sold. And that’s the main thing, to have a good record. And I don’t know how to answer your question, but I think being a good record is just as important as being a good record, because you have to get attention. And music is really very good when you can get attention, you know? And I don’t know if it’s mainstream press, but it’s like a lot of people are doing a lot of good by sharing this message. And that’s what I’m talking about, is sharing this message, and that’s what really makes a record something special. That’s what I mean. You know? It’s not about the money, it’s about having a good message. And I think it’s really important to have a good record.
Jamie J
Yeah.
Audience member
Hi, I just wanted to know if there’s any local bands that you’d recommend to me?
Jamie J
I think it’s important to have local bands. It’s really important to have local bands. We haven’t seen much local bands. We’ve seen a lot of local bands, but they’ve all been like mid-range, mid-tempo, mid-tempo. [laughter] I think that’s a good thing.
Audience member
I think a lot of people have been in this game and you’ve seen some big bands. I’ve never seen a bigger band than the British Invasion. And they’re like… They’re just really good. But, obviously you have some big bands in the UK and maybe in Europe, but are you thinking about the future of British drum & bass or will you be thinking about the future of British drum & bass?
Jamie J
I love it. I really love it. I think drum & bass is going to be around for a long time. I think drum & bass is going to be around for a long time. I think the British Invasion is going to be around for a long time. I think drum & bass is going to be around for a long time. And, yeah, I love it. I think it’s going to be around for a long time. I think British drum & bass is on the way. It’s going to be around for a long time.
Audience member
I don’t know, I don’t know.
Jamie J
Yeah. I think drum & bass is going to be around for a long time. I think I know a lot of people who’ve been in the industry for years and lived in the industry, they still don’t know whats happening in the UK drum & bass scene. It’s very important to have a good record, too. It’s very important to have a good record, because it’s really important to have a good record, because it’s going to be very hard to find a good record these days. You can’t even get a decent record out of the UK, because the UK doesn’t have the resources to make a good record. You hear about big companies making some good records and it’s just not happening. People don’t want to hear about big companies making some good records. I think it’s very important to have a good record, but can you get it out of the UK then?
Jamie J
Yeah.
Audience member
I think, for me, being in this business I’ve always had a lot of friends in Los Angeles, but I haven’t been able to really be a part of the LA drum & bass scene. I don’t know how to be that part of it, but I

====================
Dubbed the Sticky or the Dat, the Magic Mat is a leaden keyboard with a black plastic case, which is around the size of a credit card. It was designed by a group of mathematicians known as the University of Minnesot, and it was a precursor to the modern keyboard.
The Magic Mat was a small, compact keyboard, made by an unknown company called Computer & Music, and it was sold only to people who had several thousand dollars worth of computers in their homes, but it was very popular. There was still a lot of people who didn't have computers, so it was a very important device, and it was used by people who wanted to be funny.
They could make the music that they wanted to make, and they could do whatever they wanted to do. They didn't care about the money, so it was very important to them. It was very expensive to have a computer, but they had a lot of money and they wanted to make funny music.
They had a lot of computer software, and the software was very cheap, and the hardware was very expensive. They were very strict about their music, so it was really a case of being a little bit experimental and trying to do something different.
In the late ’80s, electronic music started to get a lot of airplay, and it became a big hit. It was like this big pop, and it was an electronic music machine that people could make off of, so it was like a flash in the pan that was very popular.
A lot of people like this, and it was this music of the future, but at the same time, it was really about making music that was unique to them.

We should just play something.

Todd L. Burns
When you started your label, where did you get your first studio space?
Brian Reitzell 
The studio has been for years. I was only 18 when I started, and I was in my first year of university, and I had my first studio, which was my first apartment. It had a two-story building, and a small studio room, and I started my label at the same time, because I was very young. At the time, I was working with a band, and I was working with a keyboard player, and I was working with computers.
I was writing melodies, and I was writing samples and everything, and I was writing music. I was trying to do something, and I was making music. I didn't know what I was going to put out next, and I was working with a keyboard player, and I was trying to do something different.
Todd L. Burns
What was it about this particular track that appealed to you to make different tracks, that made it good?
Brian Reitzell 
It was the next song we played, which was the Magic Mat, and that was something that I was going to do, and I knew that I wanted to do something different. That was the Magic Mat, and it was my first time in a studio. It was a time when I was working with computers, and I was working with a keyboard player, and I was working with computers, and I was working with the Magic Mat. I was going to do something different.
Todd L. Burns
It’s very interesting that you had a record that was a record that had a lot of people in the studio, because that’s the track that you made that appealed to them.
Brian Reitzell 
It was a beautiful track, and I wanted to make it special. I wanted to make it special. It was good to have someone in the studio, with a computer, making music that was special to them.
Todd L. Burns
In the background, there was also this kind of an attitude that you had.
Brian Reitzell 
That was the last track that I did, and that was the last record I did, and I don’t know, if you would have made it in a hurry. It was like a musical autobiography, and it was a musical autobiography about the people that made it. I wanted to do something special, so I had to bring in a drummer, and a bass player, and a drummer, and a keyboard player, and a singer, and an arranger, and everything. 
I think that was the last track I did, and I did it with a band of the same name. We had this band called the Bay Area Mothers, and I just put together a few songs.
They were in Milwaukee, and they were playing at the same time. It was very special, because they were a major Chicago street band, and they were very popular. They were on the charts, and they were on the radio, and they were selling

This is the quote from the song “Two Fingers On The Clock”. 
[voice over]
That was from the track “Two Fingers On The Clock”. A few words from the song, that was it. It was about a girl who was really, really good at dancing, and she was always hanging out with
Johnny Rotten, who was a member of the group, and he was a white guy, and he used to dance like a stripper, and he was really good at it. He used to go to a club called the White Tiger, and he used to have so many drinks with him that you just couldn’t drink no more, so he was a good dancer.
He used to have so many drinks that you just couldn’t drink no more,
so he was a good dancer. He used to have so many drinks that you just couldn’t drink no more, he was a good dancer. He used to go to a club called the White Tiger, and he used to have so many drinks with him that you just couldn’t drink no more, so he was a good dancer.

====================
I don’t know if you know who I am, but you probably know me as the guy who created the original vinyl of The Alamo Drafthouse.
I’ve written a book called My First Album, which was released in 2006. It was my first single. I made that record in my bedroom. I was no longer in high school, so we used to have parties. I used to play ball games. I used to play in the stadium at the Alamo. I used to play for the Alamo. I used to play for the Alamo and the Dallas Cowboys. I used to play in the Alamo. I used to play in the Alamo, for the Alamo. I used to play for the Alamo, and the Dallas Cowboy, and the Alamo Rangers. I used to play for the Alamo. I used to play for the Alamo.

As a kid growing up in Houston, I never really connected to the club scene. I never really connected to the music industry. I never really connected to those types of things. I never ever really connected to the people I grew up with. I never really connected to the people who went to concerts and who were involved in my life. I just never really connected to them. I always wanted to do something that I would never consider doing in a club. I was always looking at that as a hobby. I always thought I was going to be a musician. I never really thought I was going to be a musician. I just thought I was going to be a barista. I just thought I was going to be a waitress. I never really thought I was going to be a musician. I never really thought I was going to be a professional musician. I just thought I was going to be a barista. I was never really looking at it like that. I always thought it was just going to be a hobby. I never thought I was going to be a professional musician. At that point, I just never thought I was going to be a professional musician. I just thought I was going to be a barista. I was never really looking at it like that. I think I was just going to be a waitress.
This is the first time I really thought about doing an album. I was actually in this studio with a music producer, and this was before I even thought about doing an album. It was just something I wanted to do, and I thought it would be fun. I was just looking at it like a hobby, and it was just kind of fun. I didn’t really think about it like I was going to be a professional musician. I thought I was going to be a bartender. I thought I was going to be a professional musician. I never really thought about it like that. I never really thought about it like that. I actually thought I would be a professional musician. That’s when I actually thought about doing an album. I thought I would be good at it. I thought I would be good at it, and I thought it would be fun. I thought it would be fun. I was just looking at it as a hobby. I thought anything I can do, I can do. At that point, I was just looking at it as a hobby. It was just something that I wanted to do. 
What I wanted to do was I wanted to have an album. I wanted to have an album, and I wanted to do it. I wanted to do it, and I knew I would be good at it
====================
Berrybloom, we’ve got a couple of new tracks coming out. We’ve got a couple of new tracks coming out.
Lauren Martin
I don’t know if we can just play it right now, but we’re going to have a lot of new tracks coming out. We’ve already started to put out a couple of albums, but we still have a couple of unreleased tracks that will be coming out.
B.o.B
I mean, I know that if we’ve listened to it you’ve already got the idea that we’re going to have a lot of new tracks coming out. You’re going to hear a lot of new stuff coming out.
Lauren Martin
We’ve got a few more tracks, yes. We’ve got five more tracks coming out.
B.o.B
Yeah.
Lauren Martin
I know. This is definitely a brand new era for you guys. Can we have one of those songs on the radio?
Berrybloom
Yeah.
Lauren Martin
If we have a song, we can do one right now. I mean, in the last few years, you’ve always done great music. You’ve always been on the radio, you’ve talked about music, you have talked about politics, you’ve talked about everything. You’ve talked about what you want to do, you’ve talked about why you want to do what you want to do and at the time, it didn’t feel like that was enough. It didn’t feel like your message was enough and at the same time, it was like, “OK, this is an opportunity.” It was enough to do a record, you know?
B.o.B
I mean, I’ve been doing the same thing for a long time. I’ve been trying to do something for my community and for my people, and it’s really been about me talking to my community and trying to help and help them and to show them that this is what I want to be doing. I was born into this community, and I still am with my family in the Bronx, and I still want to be here for my people and show them that I’m here to be here and to give back. That’s the way I’m going to be doing it for them.
Lauren Martin
I mean, I think that’s a good way to start.
B.o.B
Yeah.
Lauren Martin
I mean, you just mentioned that there’s a lot of people in this room who have been impacted by what you’ve gone through, and there’s a lot of people who have missed out. Obviously, you have your family, but there’s also a lot of people who don’t know who you are or who you’re. You mentioned that you had a meeting with Donald Trump and that you were met with a lot of resistance from people. You mentioned you had a meeting with him and you’re continuing to be in contact with him. I mean, you mentioned that you don’t have a lot of people on this label, so you don’t have much support.
B.o.B
Yeah. I mean, there’s people who don’t know who I am or what I’m doing, especially in this town and in this country, and they’re looking to me for support and they’re looking to me to tell them what to do. People are looking to me for support. I don’t have the money to go out and support everyone. I’ve got to say this: There’s people who love this music, there’s people who have their feelings hurt, there’s people who feel that they’ve been neglected, there’s people that’re looking at me as someone who’s been overlooked by so much. I’ve always been a fighter. I’ve always been about fighting. I’ve always been about what I believe in, that’s what makes me the person that I am at this moment. I’m in a good place, but I’m still fighting. I’m still trying to do everything in my power to fight for the people that’ve been in my family. I’ve always had access to the people that were in my family, but I’ve always been able to do that because I’ve always been a fighter for them. I have always been a fighter for people that need to be fighting for. I’ve always been a fighter for the people

Paul Simon
This is a track called “The End.”
I think this is the first big one that we did on a major label. 
(music: Paul Simon – “The End” / applause) 
Paul Simon
So, I felt that there was so much more to make out of it, I always wanted to do more. I was a little bit like a performance artist, I wasn’t trying to make something good, I just wanted to do something more. I was always trying to get more out of it, but I didn’t want to be a more polished artist, I just wanted to do something good. 
(music: Paul Simon – “The End” / applause)
Paul Simon
So, it was an attempt to get more out of it, but it wasn’t really successful. We were a two-person company, I had a studio and a record shop and a recording studio and a label, and I had a radio show and I had a lifestyle. I wanted to be an adult, I wanted to have a home life, and I wanted to be somebody that people would want to like, so I had to do something for myself. I didn’t want to just be a baby, I wanted to be somebody that people could like, and I wanted to be somebody who would not be afraid to try something and do something different. If you have the talent, it doesn’t matter if you’re a kid, you can do something. You can’t be afraid of anything, you want to do something different. You want to do something that’s different, and that’s something that people can get it together. 
(music: Paul Simon – “The End” / applause) 
Paul Simon
I don’t think I ever talked to you like that before, I think it was just, “Hey, why don’t you do something?” I’m not sure if you know, but I think that’s one of the things that was really important for me, and I think maybe that’s why I ended up being in the band, because I wanted to do something that was different, that was different. 
(music: Paul Simon – “The End” / applause) 
Paul Simon
I mean, at the time, I was in my late 20s, and I’m in my late 20s, so I was just like a little kid. I had my family, and I had my friends, and I had my toys, and I had my things, and I had my friends who were like my brothers. I had my mother, and my father, and my mother’s stopped working, and my father didn’t want to work, so I had to work, and I had to take care of my kids. I had to take care of my house and my family, and I had to take care of my car, and I had to take care of my house. I just wanted to do something different. But that’s what I did, I just wanted to do it different. 
Paul Simon
But, I mean, it wasn’t going to be a big hit, but it was a positive thing for you as well. You obviously had a lot of success with shows, you also had a lot of success with records, and you also handled a lot of projects over a couple of years, I think. 
Paul Simon
Yeah, when I was younger, I never really thought that I liked recording. I never really thought that I was doing a good thing, but I just wanted to do something better, and I wanted to do something different, and I wanted to make something different. I wanted to make something different, and I wanted to be different, and I wanted to be different, and I wanted to be different. 
We were working in what I thought was a bad industry, and I wanted to be different, and I wanted to be different, and my mind was just like that, “I want to be different,” and I just wanted to be different. I wanted to be different, and I wanted to be different, and I wanted to do something different. And I wanted to have something different, and I wanted to do something different, and I wanted to be different. I wanted to be different, and I wanted to be different. But that was my mindset from my youth, that was my mentality from my life, “I want to be different,” and that was what I wanted to do, that was my mindset. 
At the time, I was working for the same people that I was working for as a DJ, and I was working for the same people as a record producer, and I was working for the same people
====================
When I was in the States, I was really into being in the dentist, I didn’t know anything about dentistry, I liked the idea of dentistry, but I didn’t know anything about dentistry. I was no big fan of dentistry, but it was cool because it kept you balanced and it didn’t work for me. 
I went to the dentist and they gave me an oral solution, which was good, but then they gave me a Band-Aid, which was a good thing. I wanted to take it to the dentist, because I didn’t want to hurt my teeth, so I could get it fixed. I went back to the dentist and they asked me, “What do you want?” I was like, “I want to get it fixed.” “I want to do it.” It’s like, “Do you want to fix?” They said, “No.” I said, “Do you want to get it fixed?” “No.” “Do you want to get it fixed?” “No.” I started to get it fixed, but I was getting it fixed anyway. But I had a toothache, so I’m like, “I want to go to the dentist.” I was like, “No, I don’t want to go to the dentist.” I was in a place where I would go to the dentist’s office, they wouldn’t give me an oral solution. I had to wait for a Band-Aid. 
I went to the dentist and they gave me an oral solution, which was good, but I didn’t know anything about dentistry, so I didn’t know how to get it fixed. So I went back to the dentist and he told me, “You know what? You should get it fixed. You’re old, you know what I mean?” I told him, “I got my own dentist, I’m tired of going to the dentist, I should get it fixed.” So they said, “No, you don’t.” So I had to go to the dentist and they put me on the Band-Aid, which was good, but they didn’t called me back. So I went to the dentist, and I had to wait for a Band-Aid, which was good, but I didn’t want to hurt my teeth, so I couldn’t get it fixed. So I went to the dentist and I said, “How do you do it?” They said, “We do it by mouth.” I said, “Well, how do you make it work?” “Well, we just spit on it, so we don’t have to worry about it.” So I got out of the dentist’s office, and I went back to the dentist and they gave me an oral solution, which was good, but then the Band-Aid didn’t work for me, it hurt my teeth, so I went to the dentist for more Band-Aids. 
So I went back to the dentist, and I had to wait for the Band-Aids to heal my teeth. When I was in the dentist, they said, “Well, what do you want?” I said, “I want to have a team of dentists, so I can get the help of my dentist, so I can get it fixed.” “No, you don’t.” So I went back to the dentist, and I had to wait for the Band-Aids to heal my teeth. So I went back to the dentist, and the dentist was very good, he helped me. So my dentist went back to me, and the dentist was very good, he helped me. So my dentist went back to me, and the dentist was very good, he helped me. So my dentist went back to me, and the dentist was very good, he helped me. So my dentist went back to me, and he was very good, and he said, “You know what? If you don’t get the help of your dentist, you should get it fixed.” So I did, and I went to the dentist again, and the dentist was great, they helped me. So my dentist went back to me, and he was great, he helped me. So my dentist came back to me, and he was great, he helped me. So my dentist went back to me, and he was great, he helped me. So my dentist came back to me, and he was great, he helped me. So my dentist went back to
