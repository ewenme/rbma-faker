You only have to watch one half of a football game to get the essence of it. But it’s true, even if you can’t hear something, you can still feel it.
You have to be able to feel the game. I think, in a way, it’s very important to understand the game to understand what you’re doing. When I watch a football game, I can sense that it’s going to go over the right way, because I can feel it. I think there’s a lot of things that you can do with that. But I don’t know if I feel it. But you know, it’s one of those things, we’re all about that. I mean, I’ve played with quite a few people, and I’m not too fond of playing with the same person. But I think the best route is to avoid that person, and then to be able to play with someone, because I think sometimes it’s just too much of a special thing to do.
I’ve heard people say, “Well, I played with someone, and then I played with him,” and I think people are so used to playing with a certain player that they don’t know what to do. So they can’t handle their own situation. You have to just be able to be creative. If you need to be creative, then you don’t have enough time to play.
I don’t think it’s a one-way ticket, but you have to be able to use that one person, but you don’t have to play with that person. Because the other person can be a constant source of negativity, and I think that’s what can put you off.
Audience member 
I would like to know a little bit more about the process of making these tracks. You have to be aware of things.
Lil B 
Yeah, cause I don’t know, I mean, I don’t know about you guys, but you know, just because I’m from the South, you know what I’m saying? I’m from the South, I knew what was going on. I’m not going to lie, I was a big supporter of the South, but just because of this, it doesn’t mean that I’m going to be here all the time. I’m not going to be able to be one of the biggest influences on everybody’s music, I’m not going to have a million, or I’m not going to break down the house. But I still believe in the South, and I’m not going to be saying that we’re white trash, or we’re not good, or we’re not going to be there for you, because we’re not good, we’re not going to be that, we’re not going to be that. But I’m just going to be saying that we’re not going to be that, we’re going to have our own identity, and then we’re going to be on our own, and then we’re going to be able to take care of our own stuff.
I’m not going to be on my own, but I’m going to be able to take care of it. But I’m not going to be trying to prove right, we’re never going to get there, because it’s not going to happen, and people will still be leaving us, and they’ll be going to the same places. But I’m not going to be talking about it, I’m not going to be trying to prove right, we’re not going to get there, and we’re not going to change, and we’re going to be here.
But this is just the way it is that we’re going to be, and we’re going to be where we are going to be for a long time. If you look at the last record, we were just calling and calling and calling, and we’re going to be here, and we’re going to be here. And if somebody’s not willing to make it there, then they’re going to be gone, or they’re not going to be around.
We’re going to be here, and we’re going to be able to take care of our own stuff. We’re going to be able to take care of it, and then we’re going to be able to play our music, because we don’t have to worry about what
====================
Oh my god, it’s right there.
Steve Lacy
The other thing, you know, when we did the album, we had to have some of the tracks in the album. We had to have the rest of the songs in, and some tracks didn’t make the album.
Audience Member
Just a little more of a mix.
Steve Lacy
Yeah, we had to have the rest of it. We had to have the demos, the original tracks, and we had to have the remixes, and we had to have a few of the songs up on the album.
Audience Member
Could you tell us some of…
Steve Lacy
Yeah, we had to have the songs, and we had to edit them down to the ones we wanted.
Audience Member
OK. I’m just curious.
Steve Lacy
Yeah, sure.
Audience Member
Can you tell us a little bit about that, because it’s kind of easy for us to just give you the skinny on what exactly you’re doing here?
Steve Lacy
Yeah, we had to have a lot of tracks that we had to try and get in the album. We had to play the originals of them, and the rest was out of our control. We’ve got to be smart about it. We’ve got to know how to do it. It’s just like the Beatles, we used to do it ourselves. We used to just do it. We didn’t have no money. We just had to show up, and we got to record the album, and then go to the studio, and we got to do the remixes, and we got to do the remixes. And then we got to do the album, and then the album was done.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
I know you did a lot of stuff with the Academy and the top-notch producers.
Steve Lacy
Yeah, well, I’m pretty sure I did. I think I did more than probably anyone, and I’m pretty sure I did more than everybody else. I think I did more than everybody else. I think I did more than anybody else, and I think I did more than the other people did. And I think I did more than that. And I think that’s why I did it. And it’s why people didn’t like the album, because the Grammy… I was nominated for a Grammy for the first album, and I won, and the Academy said, “Hey, that’s great, but we don’t want you to be in the Academy,” and they didn’t want you to be in the Academy. The Academy won for the best album, and it’s like, “Oh, OK, we’re going to give you the Academy,” they wouldn’t give you the Academy. “Oh, yeah, I guess we can do it.” “Yeah, we’ll give you the Academy,” they won’t give you the Academy. 
I mean, it’s like, we could do it, and it’s like, “Oh, OK, we got to do it,” because the Academy doesn’t care about your music, they’re going to make it much better than the Academy. So, it’s good to have a good Academy, because it’s going to affect your things, and it’s going to affect the things you do, and it’s going to affect the things you’d like to do, especially if you want to be in the Academy, if you want to be in the Academy.
I mean, if you want to be in the Academy, you have to do better. If you want to be in the Academy, you have to do more. It’s really, really hard work. It’s not easy. It’s not easy, and it’s not easy, but it’s gonna help. It’s gonna help, and it’s gonna help, and it’s gonna help, but it’s not something you can do, “cause you can’t be in the Academy, you can’t be in the Academy, you can’t be in the Academy, you can’t be in the Academy, you can’t be in the Academy, you can’t be in the Academy, you can’t be in the Academy, you can’t be in the Academy.” When you get into the Academy, you’re in the Academy, you’re in the Academy.
I mean, it

====================
This is a question that had to be asked. When I was in junior high school, in the days of the Internet, I was in awe of the speed of the Internet. I had the Atari 2600 and I could play all the Atari 2600 games. I had tons of Atari 2600 games and I could get 2000 for $12. There was a game called Space Invaders and I got a Super Nintendo. I was a huge Super Nintendo player, so I could make myself at home and I could play all the games. I was obsessed with the Super Nintendo and I would play all the Super Nintendo games and I would get all the software. I would play all the games for a week, and I would buy all the Super Nintendo games. I would play all the games for a year.
I got my first computer when I was about 12. I bought a Macintosh. I had no computer. I was on the computer. I sat at home, I would play all the games, and I could make music. I would make music for the Super Nintendo and I would make music for the Atari 2600. I would play all the games for a year. I got a very expensive television and I still had my Atari 2600. I made music for the Commodore, and I played all the games for me and my friends for a year, and I would make music for the Super Nintendo.
The Super Nintendo was a machine that I was obsessed with, I would get all the software, and I would make myself at home. I would make music for the Super Nintendo. I would play all the games for me and my friends for a year. I would make music for the Commodore. 
The Commodore was a machine that was extremely powerful, and it was this machine that I was obsessed with. I was on the computer. I had a lot of software, and I was always playing games, and I was always playing games. I could have a Super Nintendo, but I wanted my Super Nintendo to be the best. I wanted my Super Nintendo to be the best. I wanted my computer to be the best. I wanted my music to be the best. I didn't want my computers to be the best. I wanted my music to be the best.
The Super Nintendo was a machine that I would play all my games, and I would watch while I was playing my games, and I would see my friends play their games. I could make music for the Super Nintendo, and I would listen to their music while I was playing my games. I could play my games and listen to songs from my Super Nintendo, and I would reflect back to my friends, and I would tell them what I wanted. I couldn't just listen to the music; I needed to feel something in my body. I needed to feel something in my body. I needed to feel my energy. I needed to feel my emotions. I needed to feel my emotions. I needed to feel how my emotions were changing. I needed to feel how my body was changing. I needed to feel the changes that I was making. I needed to feel how my emotions were changing.
My computer was a gaming machine. I didn't have to spend money. I didn't have to spend money. I could just be in the computer, and I could just play games and I would be not-so-excited, because I wasn't going to spend money. I could just play games. I just wanted to be in the computer, and I would just play games.
The Super Nintendo was a machine that I was obsessed with, and I was in awe of it. I was in awe of all the games that were on the Super Nintendo. I was in awe of all the games that were on the Super Nintendo. I was in awe of all the software that was on the Super Nintendo. I was in awe of the games that were on the Super Nintendo, and I was going to get all my music and all my entertainment from the Super Nintendo.
I didn't want to spend money on the computer, I wanted to be in the computer, and I am going to be completely inspired by the Super Nintendo. 
Audience Member     
I have another question, I ask that because I know that you have actually done quite a few marijuana research. As a kid, you’re quite a heavy marijuana smoker yourself. How do you feel about the benefits of marijuana, and how do you feel about the risks?
Hugo Boss      
I’m going to say this, I’m not going to lie to you, I’m not going to lie to you, I’m not going to lie to you. I have never smoked marijuana, nor have I ever had a problem with marijuana in my life. I’ve always had a problem with marijuana, but I’ve never had a problem with it in my life. I’ve always been very supportive of people who have marijuana
====================
PCP was released as a special release for the first time in ‘94 and the Q-Tip had his own release on the label. 
TREVOR HOFFMAN 
I think a lot of people are asking, “What is this drug?” The drug was called “K2.” I think that was a big thing for the music industry, but really, really, it was a big thing for the people that were involved in the making of the music. In ‘94, there was about a fifth of the media that was into music and there was a lot of drama back then. If you saw a documentary, it was a girl named Maya Angelou, who had gone through a lot and was, “Oh, look at me,” and was very beautiful and loved. She was an icon, she was a superstar, she was somebody that everybody wanted to be like. You know, if you had a record of her, you would put them on your album. You wouldn’t put them in a club. You wouldn’t put them on a radio station. The same thing with the “K2” stuff, it was just, “This is like a hit.” I think if you saw a film about her, it would have been very beautiful, too. 
And I think what made “K2” so special was that it was produced especially for the ‘K2’ label. If you wanted to put “K2” out as a special release, there was no one else to do it, and the music industry was big. I don’t know, I think it was a no-brainer. It was like if you had a record that was on a label, you could put “K2” out. If you wanted to put it out as a special release, there was no other label, it was just the Q-Tip. And the boys from the “K2” label, they were very, very graphic and they were very graphic, and they were just onto it, and I think they were going to put “K2” out as a special release. It was incredibly colorful, with the combinations of colors and the patterns and the textures. And all of that was just in the music. And I think that was very, very, very important for people to understand what we were doing, and how the music industry worked back then. 
DAVIDE BORTOT
There’s one track that is the most famous in “K2.” It’s called “K2” so it was on all the major label records, so it was a big hit record. For some reason, I don’t know why, but it’s just great to see that music black people still care about, and they still want to listen to music. That’s probably the best example of the fact that it’s a racial thing, that it’s a very, very important point. I don’t know, I’m African American, but I think I’ll be honest with you, there’s a lot of people who are not black. But there’s a lot of black people who are interested in music, and that’s why I think it’s important to listen to music, because there’s more opportunities in the black community, because there’s more opportunities than in the white community to have a chance. 
But if you listen to the type of music that I know, a lot of the time, the white people that are listening to that is listening to a lot of rap music. They’re listening to hip-hop, and they’re listening to rap music that’s not necessarily that commercial. They’re listening to pop music that’s not necessarily or more popular. And they’re listening to hip-hop that’s not necessarily, “Oh, I want to know, this is what house music was like.” 
TV, they’re listening to stuff. I mean, not because I’m looking for something, but because I’m interested in things that I can relate to. And I’m interested in things that I can relate to, and that’s what I’m doing now, and I want to get bigger and be the best. I’m doing what I need to do, and I’m going to the next level. I’m going to get better, and I’m going to be a better person. But I’m not going to be boring. 
DAVIDE BORTOT
How do you feel about the fact that you’re an African
====================
It’s just a little bit of a cynical thing, but at one point I think in the ‘80s when they were working with me on a movie, I was working for a film, I was doing this movie, I was working on a TV show, I was working on a radio show for a long time. Like a lot of producers, they had to ask me, “Why don’t you just do a movie?” Like, “We don’t have money,” and I had a lot of money but I had to do a movie and so they would pay me $20,000, like, “Yeah, we hear you’re doing a movie and we want to do something like this.” Because, you know, I’m not happy with my movies, but I know that money is not the issue, it’s the quality or I have to do something good if I want to get a lot of money. You know?
Craig Mazin 
So it’s all about the money?
Andrew Scheps 
It kind of is, you know. It’s the money, but I think it’s the quality. If you want to do something really good, you have to do something that makes you feel good. And I think that’s the key, you do something really good. I like to do something that I think people will like, that they can sit down and watch and tell their friends, “He did a good movie.” [laughter] You know? Don’t get me wrong, I’m a very popular producer, but I don’t want to be known as a famous producer, I want to be known as a great producer. I want to be known for doing films and TV shows. I want to be known for doing commercials, but I want to be known for movies, I want to be known for commercials.
Craig Mazin 
I think a lot of Fox Searchlight has been involved in this movie?
Andrew Scheps 
Yeah, yeah. [laughter]
Craig Mazin 
And they are also the ones that have the movie rights, so because the movie is going to be released, and then they can do their movie. So you can say, “Oh my god, it’s going to be big. It’s gonna be a hit,” but then they can go and do the movie and then you can do your movie. And I think that’s the way it works, you can have a movie and a TV show and an album, and you can do your movie and then you can do your live music show and then you can do a music video. And I think that’s the way it works.
Andrew Scheps 
I think the movie, the movie is still going strong, to be honest. I don’t think we’ve seen any bad reviews from critics, I think only five of them have said something negative about it, and they’re almost all... [laughs]...
Craig Mazin 
Yeah, yeah.
Andrew Scheps 
...because I think it’s been a film that has been critically acclaimed. The movie producer who just said something negative about it, I mean, I don’t know if they like it or not, but I don't think it’s a bad movie, I think it’s been a hard movie to make. And I think it’s a good thing that the movie’s been made, because it’s not going to be released in theaters as easily as it was made. I think New Line and Columbia, they’re really good at making movies. But they’re not going to be releasing it in theaters as easily as they made it. You know what I mean?
Craig Mazin 
Oh, yeah.
Andrew Scheps 
Yeah. I think it’s going to be a good movie, I think it’s going to be a hit as well, but I think it’s going to be a hit in a different way. I think that’s the way it’s going to be. I know that I’m not going to get the credit, but I think that’s really the way it’s going to be.
Craig Mazin 
Yeah.
Andrew Scheps 
Yeah. This is the way it’s going to be. It’s going to be a movie that people are going to be talking about and they’ll be wondering about, because this is a movie that people will be talking about. It’s going to be a hit.
Craig Mazin 
I think it’s going
====================
The first time I saw this scene in a movie was in the movie Chinatown, I remember in the beginning it was the first time I saw. I was really interested in like, the art of making movies. I wanted to do a movie, I wanted to do a movie and I was just like, I'm really interested in cinema as a medium.
Torsten Schmidt
When you first made your movie, it was a film about a woman named Lucy who was kidnapped by the mob, by the Chinese. What were you thinking at that time?
Dane DeHaan
I thought, “I can do a movie, it’s always been done, it’s always been a movie.” It was the first time I saw the movie in a movie. I was five-years-old, I wasn’t even born yet, I was watching and I was like, “Wow.” I don’t know if you're familiar with the movie, but it was a film about a woman named Lucy, who was kidnapped by the Chinese and tortured for 24 hours. I was very interested in the fact that there was an American movie about a woman, a young woman, who was abducted by the Chinese, and they tortured her for 24 hours. It was the first movie ever made. I was like, “Wow.” I was like, “I can do a movie,” and I thought the movie was really good. I knew it was really good, I knew that it was a film. I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie. I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie. I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie, I was doing a movie.
Torsten Schmidt
So when you were doing your movie, do you have a script or did you write your own screenplay?
Dane DeHaan
I wrote my own screenplay, out of curiosity and I wanted to do a movie, but there was no script. There was no script. All I wrote was “The Bride,” I just wrote it and I didn’t know what to do, I just wrote it and I didn’t know how to do it. I was just like, “This is so funny, I can do it, I can do it!” I thought the movie would be good, it’s always been a movie, it was always a movie, it’s never been done, it’s always been done by someone else. I wanted to do a movie, I wanted to do a movie and it was like, “This is a movie, this is a movie, this is a movie.”
Torsten Schmidt
You were talking about a very different kind of filmmaking and you were also using film editing to do a film, but you were also using film to create a special effect. Do you have a special effect you thought was going to be really interesting?
Dane DeHaan
I think I did have a special effect in mind, but I don’t think I thought it was going to be good, but I want to do it, and I want to do a movie. We’re going to do a movie someday, but it’s a movie, it’s not going to be, “Oh, I want to do a movie, I want to do a movie.” I just wanted to do a movie.
Torsten Schmidt
But you also had a very unique approach to film editing as well, and I think that was something that really stood out for you as well.
Dane DeHaan
Yeah, I think I had a very unique approach to film editing. I don’t think I had any other editing, I just had the film.
Audience Member
I mean, I know you did some movies, but what was that film?
Torsten Schmidt
It was a film called The Princess Bride.
Dane DeHaan
It was a movie about a Christian couple, a couple of European couples. It was about a couple of women who were kidnapped and tortured for 24 hours. I was very interested in the fact that there was a Christian movie in the early ‘60s, it was called The Princess Bride, and it was a very sweet, beautiful movie. I wanted to do a movie, it was called The Princess Bride.
Audience Member
Why did you choose to go to the
====================
There’s this theory of music, which is that you can make music, you just have to. It’s not like making a song and it’s not like you can sit there and do a song. It’s not like, “No, I don’t have to do it. I don’t have to write a song, I don’t have to do it. I don’t have to be a producer, I don’t have to be a songwriter. I just have to listen to music, and I just have to do it.” So, I have to read music, I have to read lyrics, I have to listen to music. It’s just, “What do you want me to do with this?” I’m like, “I want to do it.” I keep asking myself, “Can I do it? Can I do it?” And I keep giving up. When I was younger, I thought I could do it, but it always seemed like I’d have trouble. I mean, I could play the tape, I could do the vocals, I could do the guitar, I could do the drums, I just could’t play it. It wasn’t like I could sing it, I couldn’t do it. I just had to listen to it and I just had to listen to the song and I just had to listen to the lyrics. But what I did to fit in with the music and my life, I did it very, very well. 
Audience member
I’ve been listening to music for 20 years. I’ve heard a lot of different music, like R&B, rock, electronic, whatever. But, what are the songs that you listen to most? And tell me, what songs are you most like? 
A Tribe Called Quest
I’m like, “Well, there are a lot of them. I like hip-hop, but I don’t know what to like about it. I like soul, but I don’t know what to like about it. I don’t like rock, but I like pop, but I don’t know what to like about it. I like disco, but I don’t know what to like about it. 
Audience member
I think your favorite song was probably “Biggie the Love Sponge.” 
A Tribe Called Quest
I’m like, “Biggie the love sponge, my favorite song ever.” 
Audience member 
What was your favorite track? 
A Tribe Called Quest
I just love “Biggie the Love Sponge.” 
Audience member 
“Biggie the love sponge.” 
A Tribe Called Quest
“Biggie the love sponge.” 
Audience member 
Yeah, we just played that song. Thank you. 
A Tribe Called Quest
Thank you. 
Audience member
I just wanted to know, if you had to make a song for a group of friends, how do you know which one will be the best? 
A Tribe Called Quest
Obviously, the first one I knew I liked was “Biggie the Love Sponge.” When we did the song, we just played it. We just played it out loud and we just played it for people, and then we just played the track to them. We didn’t worry about any lyrics or anything. I just played it to them like it was a song, and then I just wanted it to be like a club record. I wanted it to be danceable, I wanted it to be funky, I wanted it to be something like a disco record. I just wanted it to be something that people could dance to. I just wanted it to be something different. 
Audience member
Yeah, it’s always been like that, but, obviously, you went to more of a house record. 
A Tribe Called Quest
Yes. 
Audience member
That’s like, what is it like to make a dance record? 
A Tribe Called Quest
It’s very difficult. I mean, with a house record, I play it for people. I don’t want to be too hard on people, but I think that’s what I’ll have to do until I’m old enough to make a house record. I don’t want to be too hard on myself, but I’ll have to do it. 
Audience member
Do you think about the song, “Biggie the Love Sponge?”

====================
Give it a whirl, man. I was born in New York, in the Bronx. I was born and raised here. I went to the Bronx High School, and I was a student at the Bronx High School. I was a student at the Bronx High School.

That’s why I got into high school. I wanted to be like I was, you know what I’m saying? I’m going to have a better life than you, even if you’re from New York, or they’re from New York. You know what I’m saying? I want to be like you, just because I’m from here. You know, when I was growing up, they used to call me The Bronx I was. But it was still the Bronx. I was still the Bronx. I was born and raised there.

But, you know, that’s where I’m from. I love it, man. I love it. What’s wrong with New York? It’s like it was always here. That’s what I like about it. I’m from here. I love everything about New York. You know, even if you’re from the South Bronx or the East Bronx or whatever, it’s still the Bronx. I love everything about New York. You know, of course, New York was founded by slaves. I was born and raised in the Bronx. My dad was a slave, and my mom was in the slave trade, and my two brothers, my brothers are slaves, you know what I’m saying? That’s why I’m so big into New York, there’s still so much to love about it. You know what I’m saying? I love it.

We can’t hide from the fact that we’re an African-American nation, and we have a history of slavery and we have people like white people who’ve been enslaved. We have people who work in factories, and we have people who work in the food industry. We have people who make watches, and we have people who make toys, you know what I’m saying? We have people who make cars, and we have people who make music. We have people who are in the street, and we have people who are on the streets. You know what I’m saying? Our history is something to be celebrated, especially when it comes to music and art and all of that stuff. You know, although we have a lot of other problems, you know what I’m saying? It’s just important to be proud of our history, and to be able to tell the story of our people.

When I was a teenager, you know what I’m saying? Back in those days, you didn’t even know who was white, and you knew what was black. You didn’t even know where the clubs were from. You didn’t know what to do with your money. You got a lot of different ways to make a living out of it. So, I was born and raised in the Bronx, and I was brought up in the Bronx. I went to the Bronx High School, and I was a student at the Bronx High School. I was born and raised here.
I wanted to be like you, just because I was born and raised here. What’s wrong with New York? It’s like it was always here. The South Bronx was always a place where people worked. I was a student at the Bronx High School. They used to call me The Bronx I was, because it was the Bronx. It was the Bronx. They used to call me The Bronx I was.
(music: Lyn-Ann – “The Sky Is Falling” / applause)
When I was a kid, I was always in awe of everything that was being thrown on you by your parents. You know what I’m talking about? You know what I’m talking about? They were white, but they just had it good. They didn’t have any problems. They didn’t have no problems with anything. They just had a lot of love. They didn’t have any problems with anything. I never had to go to school. I never had to work. I never had to be in jail. I never had to go to work. I never had to deal with any of that shit. I never had to worry about money. I never had to worry about anything. I just knew I was going to be a good person just because I was born and raised here and I was raised in the Bronx.
But, then, when I was in school, I was always hearing about stuff, it was just like, “Man, he really cares
====================
It’s hard to say if the two things are connected or not, but the point is that a lot of people in LA and New York, they don’t really want to be in Los Angeles or New York, they don’t want to be in New York, they don’t want to be in LA. In fact, a lot of them have moved to LA- I think, it’s the most expensive place in the world to live, and I think they’re still looking for somewhere to start over. But they’re still looking for somewhere to live, and they’re still looking for some shelter and some help. But the point of the song is that if you want to get out of your house, you need help. If you want to get out of your house, it’s from a shelter. A shelter is where you can run away and get help, because the situation is so bad, and they have so much money. I think they can’t afford to pay for you to be in the shelter. It just comes down to your necessity, and it’s very, very difficult to have a shelter where you can just give your money to the homeless. There’s no help, there’s no services, no money, and you’re cold. So, if you want to get out of your house, you need help. If you want to get out of your house, you need a place to live. If you want to get out of your house, you need a shelter. If you want to get out of your house, it’s from a shelter. If you need a shelter, you need a place to live. It’s a very difficult situation, and they’re waiting on the government to provide help, and now they’re not going to help. But I think they’re trying to get you some help. If there is help, they’re doing their best to help, and if there isn’t, they’re not going to help.
Todd L. Burns
What is the one area that you’re referring to here, Los Angeles, where do you live at any point in your life?
Trevor Horn
It depends when I’m in LA. I’m not a homeless person. I’m not homeless. But I’m not homeless, I’m a child of immigrants, I’m a descendant. If I have a child that’s undocumented, I’m a member of the immigration workers. I don’t know how many, but I’m sure there are a tremendous number of people in LA that have children. It depends, because, I mean, I’m one of the first people to ever come to America, I’m the first black person to come to America, I could be here now. So I’m definitely a part of the population. But I’m not homeless, and I’m not a child of immigrants, I just want the world to know that I’m a son of a b******d. I’m not a child of the 9-to-5, I’m a son of the bus driver. I want a job. I’m a son of the truck driver. I’m a son of a bus, I want a job, but I’m not a son of the 9-to-5. I’m not a son of a 9-to-5, I’m a son of the bus driver. I’m a son of the bus driver, I’m a son of an immigrant. And I’m a son of a bus, but I am a son of my father, and my father was a bus driver. I’m a son of the migrant worker, I’m a son of the immigrant worker, but I’m still a son of the b******t.
Todd L. Burns
How, in Los Angeles, do you decide where to live?
Trevor Horn
I’m not sure about Los Angeles. I’m not sure how long I’m gonna be here. I’m not sure about LA. I don’t know if I’m gonna live here forever. I’m not sure if I’m gonna be here for a long time. I’m not sure about LA. I could be in the Los Angeles area forever. I could be in Torrance forever. I can’t tell you when I’m gonna be back here. I’m not sure how long I’m gonna be here.
Todd L. Burns
You mentioned your father�
====================
You know, when I was younger I would always be on the couch and I would sit there and watch TV, and then I would just go to bed at night. And I would be like, “Oh, OK.” I mean, there’s some people who are very bad at music, but for me, it was never that big of a deal, because I would just shut myself down, because I didn’t want to do it. I’d rather do something else. And then I’d like to do something that’s more interesting. And I’d rather be in a space that’s more interesting than being in a studio. In the early ‘90s, you know, I was listening to Hip-Hop all the time, and I had a friend who was producer for a record company called Universal Music. And they had a label called Creative Artists, which might have had a record out every Tuesday, and I was like, “I want to do something, so that I can have something to listen to.” So, I decided to make a record, and it was an 8-track. And I just made it on my laptop, and I would play it to people, and I would invert the horns, and I would play it to people who were listening to Skrillex. And I would play it to people who were listening to Skrillex. And the first piece I ever did, in the eighth track, was a remix of Frank Ocean. And I didn’t want to do it like that, because Frank was just doing something he really respected. And I was just doing what I thought he should do.
Gerd Janson
So, what is it about Frank Ocean that appealed to you?
Michael Rother 
Just the fact that he was into making records like Skrillex got more attention than anything. And I mean, Skrillex was like a big thing in the ‘80s and ‘90s, and I guess now that’s over, and Skrillex is like a little bit of a big hit. And it’s like he’s still doing it, and he’s still doing it. But what I love about it, is that it’s not just a pop record, it’s not just a hit, it’s not just a remix. It’s not just a production. It’s not just a remix. It’s just a piece of music. And I think that’s what I really like about it is that it’s just a piece of music. And I just think it’s got that quality, that I just liked about it. And it’s just of a certain type of music. And the whole thing is about coming to a place where you’re like, “OK, I needed to do something,” and then you can’t really do it. And it’s like, if you listen to an album, and you listen to the whole album, you know that it’s just a song, and it’s not about the lyrics. It’s not about the emotion, it’s not about the music. It’s just about the music. And that’s what I’m going for. That’s what I like about it.
Gerd Janson
So, when you listen to an album like Frank Ocean, it doesn’t feel like you’re listening to an album that’s not from your perspective?
Michael Rother 
I think so. I think it’s the first time I listened to an album from a producer I really respected. And I think that’s what’s cool about it, is that it’s not like I listened to a bunch of beats. I think I listened to an album by a producer that I really loved from the beginning the first time I heard it. And I think that’s what’s cool about it, is that I listen to an album by a producer I really like from the beginning, and then I listen to something like Frank Ocean, and I think that’s just the way it goes.
Gerd Janson
And the producer you liked from the beginning, was the one you’re listening to now?
Michael Rother 
Yeah, it was the producer that was doing it at the time that had the best records. And that was the producer that came to me that I really liked, and that was the producer that I really liked. But I think I had a choice. I thought I had to choose one or the other, but I didn’t. I didn’t choose to do something that I really liked. And then

Brian Reitzell 
It is interesting that when we started to think about it, at that point, we were talking about it as a film that would be made for the people in the theater, and they would be able to watch what we do, and then we would be able to make our own record. And that was an idea that we would never have thought about, and then we would do it. And that was the way that we wanted to do it. And that was the way that we wanted to do it. And when we did it, we wanted to do it the way that we wanted to do it. 
And we have no regrets. We just do what we want to do, and if you don’t like it, to the extent that we can, we will stop. Because we are not doing it the way that other people do it, like releasing a record that is made in a studio and it’s not the way that you can do it. 
But we are kind of like that, “We did this record, we did that record, and we are going to make another record.” We have a lot of different ways of doing it, but we always want the fans to be able to find the record, and we want to pay them per album, and that’s the way that we’ve always done it, and that’s the way that we’ve always done it.
Torsten Schmidt
So in the end, you have to accept that the people that were involved in your production, like the late Brian Reitzell was involved in a lot of your productions, are involved now, because you were the same people that were involved in that record, right? 
Brian Reitzell 
Absolutely. In fact, I was involved in that record. It was a very special record, and it’s very easy to make a record like that, you know what I mean? People who can’t understand that, you know what I mean? And they are right. I don’t care, because it’s only the people who have seen it that have seen the record that they understand. And that’s the way that we have always done it, and it’s what we have always done. 
Torsten Schmidt
When you were making those records, you have that thing about the band that you were talking about, “We’ve always known,” that people would be interested in listening to it. And when you released the first record, did you have any kind of expectation that people would be interested in listening to it? 
Brian Reitzell 
I don’t know if it was expectations, or what it was. I don’t know. Maybe people were expecting a record like that from us, or the record that we did, and I don’t know. There was a record that I did that was released in the UK, and we were involved in the record.
So if people were expecting a record like that, then you have to understand that we were involved in it. And if people were expecting something like that, then we were involved in it. And we did it and that’s the way we’ve done it. 
Torsten Schmidt
And you were going to finish your career by making a film, right? 
Brian Reitzell 
I think that we ended up doing a film. And that was the way that we started. We always wanted to do a film, so that people would know what we do, and would be interested in it. 
Torsten Schmidt
And you were involved in making a movie, right? 
Brian Reitzell 
Yeah. And that was the way that we started, and that is how we started our careers. 
Torsten Schmidt
And when you do a film, do you draw up the script yourself, or do you do it by yourself? 
Brian Reitzell 
We did it by ourselves, and that’s the way that we started it. It was a very special record, and it was just the opposite, because it was recorded in the studio. And once we did it, we captured it, and we did our own movie, and that is the way that we started our careers. 
Torsten Schmidt
You know, I mean, the reason I know that we are talking about this is because the guy that you worked with on that record, is also a producer that you worked with on that record, is also a producer that you worked with on a lot of your records. And you are in a very similar lineup, I think. You have Brian Reitzell, you have that sound that you have, and you have Roland Anderson, and you have the guys who we had on “The
====================
People are really fascinated by this idea of someone coming from the North of England and coming to Ireland. Who are those people? Is it a fluke? What is this stuff?
Toby Laing
I think what I’m referring to is the fact that in spite of the fact that I’m from the south side of England, I’m not from the city and I’m not from the south of England. The idea of a person coming by themselves to a country and wanting to do something and wanting to share what they have with the world and wanting to create something, and I don’t know if you guys have a story like that, but it’s a very different thing being from north London and being from the south of England. I think that’s really interesting.
I’m going to be in Liverpool, so I’m going to be able to visit the Liverpool area and see the city and the town and the country and go to clubs, be part of the city and go to clubs, go to festivals. I mean I think there’s a big club in Liverpool, a big music festival, a big dancehall festival, and I’m going to meet a lot of people there.

Hi. You mentioned earlier that this was a very good place for you to do your music.
Toby Laing
Yes. What I was talking about, I think what we were talking about is, I’m not going to do a record really, I’m not going to be a DJ or something, I’m not going to be anything. I’m not going to be working in a record shop. I’m not going to be doing film. I’m not going to be doing music videos, I’m not going to be doing anything. I’m going to be keeping to my life, because I’ve been working here for so long. I was born here, I was raised here, I’m probably over the age of 40. I’ve been here since I was six years old. I grew up here, I’m a huge fan of music, I love music. It’s a great place to be, that’s what I’m going to be doing.

I’m going to be back in the music industry, I’m going to be back in the music industry. It’s been a great experience for me.
I’m going to be back in Liverpool, it’s been a great experience, and I’m going to be back. I’m going to be back in the music industry, and I’m going to be back. I’m going to be back in the music industry. It’s a great place to be, and I’m excited.
This is my first time going to see a big festival, and the fact that I’ve been here for so long, I’m heading back to Liverpool for the first time. I’m going to be back in Liverpool tomorrow, and you’ll see a lot of people from Liverpool. It’s been great. I’m excited.

====================
So, you’re playing around a lot with mixing and processing and have your own productions. How did you start getting into it, because you also do a lot of electronic music?
Fuzz
I’ve always been a producer and I have been in the industry for a long time. I started making electronic music when I was 16. I was very into electronics and getting into electronic music, electronics, and electronics was the first electronic music I ever saw. I was like, “Wow, this is really cool.” My parents, the first to buy a computer, never got a computer, but they had a cassette player, and I was a big electronics freak. I was a big electronics fan.
My best friend was a computer scientist who was a computer engineer, and I was like, “Wow, this is cool.” I was like, “I don’t know what you’re talking about, but my computer is super cool.” I was like, “I should have a computer,” I’m like, “I don’t know what this is, but it’s cool.”
I always wanted to be a computer scientist, but I didn’t want to be a computer engineer, and I didn’t want to graduate college, so I was like, “Well, what are you talking about?” I just wanted to do it. I just wanted to be a computer scientist, and I just wanted to do it.
I was like, “Wow, this is cool.” I was like, “I think I’m going to go to college.” I was like, “I’m going to go to college.” I was like, “I don’t know what you’re talking about, but this is going to be cool.” I was like, “I’m going to go to college.” I was like, “Wow, this is cool.” I was like, “I think I’ll go to college.” I’m not a college graduate, but I’m going to college.
Audience member 
What were your chances to get into college?
Fuzz
I was going through a really tough time. I started college after high school, and I was the only one in the family who was not going to college. I was the only one who wasn’t going to college and was planning to go to college when I was 15, 16. I was the only one who was going to college, and I was the only one who was going to college, and I had no idea. I used to work construction, and I used to work construction jobs, but I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I didn’t know what I was going to do, but I was a rebellious teenager. I was out on the streets, picking fights, and I was always throwing rocks, and I would do that to get my attention.
I had no clue what I wanted to do. I didn’t know what it was going to be like to be a professional musician, because I was never a professional musician. I was always just happy to be out here. I was always out there on the street, and I never knew what I wanted to do, but I wanted to be a computer scientist, and I wanted to be a computer engineer, so that was my band. I wanted to get into college, so I went to college.
It was a good time. I was going through a really tough time at the time. I was going through a really bad breakup, with the breakup of my boyfriend, who I was with, and he left me. I left him with a lot of money, and he left me with a lot of money. My mother was a single mother, and my father was a labor worker, and I needed to find a job right away. I started college before we were even born, so it was pretty easy.
Audience member 
What was it about that that made you want to be a computer scientist?
Fuzz
I was a computer scientist, but I was a math nerd, and I was into math, and I liked to play the guitar and play the guitar, and I knew I wanted to be a musician, but I didn’t know how to be a musician. I was always the computer nerd, but I was always the math nerd, and I needed to get into college, so I went to college, and I graduated college, and I went to a college in Chicago, and then I was writing music, and I was performing, and then I was an art student, and I was studying art, and

The last thing I remember was I was walking out of the house I was living in, and I saw a guy walking down the street and I was like, “Hey, why is he walking down the street?” I just didn’t know what to do. I started crying. I was a child and it was very hard to get out of bed in the morning for a living and I just didn’t know what to do. I just knew I wanted to work and it was easy because I was living in the suburbs in Philadelphia. I was just happy to be there. I was in a good place. I was in a good school. I got the best food, and I saw a guy walking down the street. I was like, “Hey, why is he walking down the street?” I just didn’t know what to do. I was homeless. I was just going to work at a restaurant, and I got job offers. It was a good time. I was working at a restaurant. I was enjoying myself. It was a good time. I was enjoying everything. I’m still enjoying myself. I was just happy. I was just going to work, and I was enjoying this place.

This is what it did for me. It was great and I had a dream to do it and then go back to my day job, and then I was like, “Well, what do I do now? Get a job?” I was looking for something else, but I was still happy and I was in a good place. I was going to a restaurant and I was getting ready to start my career again and then I just decided to get a job and do it again.

I would have been in the restaurant. I would have been a cab driver. I would have been a waitress or I would have been a barista. I would have been a cook. I would have worked in the kitchen. I was always a student of food. I was always very curious about, “What is this food?” I was always looking for something to make me happy, and then it was the right time. I had a dream to do it, and then I was going to the right place.

Torsten Schmidt
Maybe we could take a few questions from the audience, please.
Audience Member 
Sorry, I wanted to ask you about the experience of working in a fish fry, and about situations like the one you were in at that time, and being a homeless person.
Julianna Russom 
I’m not gonna lie, I was homeless as a child. I was really, really, really poor. I was hungry and I was sleeping on the streets. I was sleeping on the street, and I was just hungry for something to eat, and I was kinda miserable. I was in the restaurant, and I was working there. It was just really bad. I was like, “Wow, I just got off the street.” 
So I’m just going to say this one thing, I always try to be as generous as possible to anybody that might ask, because it’s just something that the customers, it’s just just something that I had to have in my life. I was lucky that I was also a part of the family. I was always an older woman, and I always took care of my parents, and I always looked out for them, and I never put myself in a situation that I thought would be ideal, for any of the kids that I was working with.
With the music that I was doing, I always wanted to be able to do it, and to be able to do it as a full-time woman was really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really
====================
I just want to say I love everything about this scene. I used to go to this club when I was younger, and it was the most beautiful club in New York. It was like the sixth- or seventh-largest clubs in New York, and it was amazing. I used to go to that club, and I used to watch them dance. And I used to live there. And it was like, “Ooh!” They used to have this huge, big, big dancefloor, and they used to have a lot of talent, because they had a lot of Jamaican talent. They had all these great dancers. So I used to go to this club, and I used to watch them dance, and I used to go to this club and I used to watch them dance. And I used to go to the club as a guest. And I used to go to the club as a guest, and I was like, “Oh yes!” And I was like, “Oh my God!” I used to go to this club as a guest, and I was like, “Oh yeah!” I was there every night. And I was still there, and I was an amazing dancer. And I was still a guest, and I was a loving, amazing mother. And I was still a good friend of the club. And if you see me, and you see my children, sometimes I will just disappear into this life, and I will just be around, and I will do whatever it takes to get away from this, and I will be there for my son. And I will stay in my room until I can get away from you. I don't want to hear nothing, don't talk to no one. You just go to the bathroom. You don't talk to nobody, don't bother no one. You just go to the bathroom and you just go to the bathroom. I was always around my son. And I always tried to get him to do the same thing that he was doing, because he was the first child that I ever saw him do. When I was your age, you couldn't do anything, and you did something. And you did something. And I wanted him to do the same thing, and I wanted him to be good at whatever he was doing, and I didn't want everybody to be like, “Yeah, I love him, he makes good music, he is cool, he is the best DJ in the world,” and it’s going to be like, “No!” I didn't want my children to be a part of that mentality. So I just always tried to be good to everybody. And I always wanted them to be good to me, because I was the first person I ever saw my son do. And I always saw my son doing something that he was doing. And I saw my son doing something that he was doing, so I always tried to stay in my room and be around my son. And if I was down the hall, I would just be the first thing that I see him do, and I would just be like, “Oh my God!” I would just be like that, and then he would come outside and I would just step in front of him and hug him, and we would just be like, “Oh my God!” And then when I was like, “Oh my God!” And then people would start asking me questions. And then after that, I just had to get away. I had to get away from everything. I had to get away from the noise and the noise of the dancefloor. I had to get away from all that. And then when I was in there, I would have to say, “I’m sorry for the noise, I’m sorry for the noise.” I had to say, “I’m sorry for the noise.” And I had to say, “I’m sorry for the noise, I’m sorry for the noise.”
And then I had to say, “I’m sorry for the noise.” I had to say, “I’m sorry for the noise, I’m sorry for the noise.” And then I had to say, “I’m gonna get out of here.” And then I would just come outside, and I would just have a cigarette and then I would just say, “Oh my God! I’m sorry for the noise.” And then I would just go back inside and get the coffee, and then I would say, “Oh my God! I’m sorry for the noise, I’m sorry for the noise.” And then I would just go back inside, and once I had the coffee, and after my son left the
====================
There was a time when you could get away with a lot
anything. And then the internet came along and kind of gave it a rest, but there was a
time when you could get away with a lot more. You know, you could be someone
who actually played a record and they could be someone who actually listened to it,
and then you could have a record that you would like to have, and then the internet would
come along and you could have a record that you could like.
Todd L. Burns 
But if you look at this as a recording, the fact that it’s got a title and you can
be in the studio, and that’s not the case now, it’s taken over the record industry. The
movie industry, for example, can’t put out the movie that you want to put out the poster on,
and they have to put it out the movie poster, and they have to put it out the movie, and
they have to put it out the movie. That movie would never get to a screen. And I think that
is where the culture of music is going. And even if you have a movie, it’s not going to
get to a screen. You have to put it out on DVD, and even if you have a radio, you have to put it
on DVD, and even if you have a iTunes, there’s no way for the iTunes to play it. And when it does,
it’s going to be a movie. And if it is a movie, it’s going to be a movie. So, I think that
was the point where music became very important. And it wasn’t just a matter of the
music industry, it was also the movie industry, and it was always in the movie industry,
and that was still the case. You know, you could get away with a lot of things, you could
get away with shooting the wrong guy, you could get away with stealing the car, you could get away with a
lot of things. And that’s exactly what happened to me. I had no intentions of getting the movie
set up, or the music industry, or anything like that, but it's a reality. And it was the
timing of the internet, and the music industry really took over. I’m not talking about the
movie industry. I’m talking about the television industry. I’m talking about
the radio industry, and the movie industry. And I think that’s what’s happened to us.
Todd L. Burns 
This is the same kind of ground that you’ve been working on for years.
Todd Burns 
[laughs] I’m not exactly sure how to say it. I’m not going to say it’s a bad thing, but it’s
it’s definitely in the direction of the music industry that it’s taking over. I think that’s
why there’s so much negativity and anger and hate and hate in the music industry,
because they used to have all these great creative minds that were in there, and they used to be
really good, and they used to have a really strong creative team that they were on top of, and they
used to have a lot of cool people. But now, I think the movies are just a
little bit better than the television, because it’s not as good a production, and it’s not
as good a casting. And I think that’s what’s going on. The majority of film,
the majority of television, is not made by the artist, it’s made by the studio, and the end result is
better. And the talent behind it is just not there anymore, and it’s not going to be a
story. It’s going to be a movie, and it’s going to be a television show, and that’s what it’s going to
be. But the film industry is just as bad as the television industry, and it’s just
getting better. And I think that’s what’s going on. I think that’s what we’ve been
going through for years. And I think that’s why we’re here now.
Todd L. Burns 
I think we have a question, which is, can you give us a little insight into what you do in the studio?
Todd Burns 
Yes, sir.
Todd L. Burns 
OK.
Todd Burns 
I’m going to throw out a little bit of information on the recording studio, because I think
it’s really that simple
====================
Bug-eyed
That is what I’m talking about.
L.A. Confidential 
I’m sorry. 
(music: Lady Antebellum – “All I Wanna Do” / applause)
That was Lady Antebellum’s “All I Wanna Do”.
Bug-eyed 
No, that was the “All I Wanna Do” album. 
(music: Lady Antebellum – “All I Wanna Do” / applause)
That was the first album I ever bought to play to my mother. She had a car accident when she was a kid and she had to walk around the side of the road because she was so blind. 
L.A. Confidential 
You mean, it’s the first album she had to buy? 
Bug-eyed 
No, no, I mean the first album she bought was a record that she had bought, which was called “Caught in the Heat.” It was about her mother and her drinking problems, and she was a drunk, and she was a lot of trouble, and she was in a car accident, and she had to walk. It was the first album she had, I have to say, she was really rough, but she was a really good mother. I don’t know what kind of car was she driving, but she had a car accident when she was a kid. 
(music: Lady Antebellum – “All I Wanna Do” / applause)
Lady Antebellum is a lot of trouble. 
L.A. Confidential 
You’re talking about young mothers, right? 
Bug-eyed 
Yes, yes.
L.A. Confidential 
In the ’80s, I mean? 
Bug-eyed 
Yes, I mean. 
L.A. Confidential 
I guess, it was a bit of a different time then, but you’re talking about a lot of women, you know, with a lot of drinking problems. 
Bug-eyed 
Yes, sir.
L.A. Confidential 
I mean, we have a lot of mothers who are addicted to alcohol, but they didn’t drink themselves to death. They didn’t have to drink, but they tried. 
[laughter]
Bug-eyed 
No, but they did, sir. 
L.A. Confidential 
You just mentioned your mother, so do you think it was very effective, having a mother who had the ability to give you a lot of self-confidence? 
Bug-eyed 
Yes, sir.
L.A. Confidential 
I mean, did she drink herself to death? 
Bug-eyed 
No, sir. I mean, she had to drink to death, but we could do it, and she didn’t drink herself to death. She had to give her children the strength they needed to get through the day, and she didn’t drink herself to death. 
L.A. Confidential 
That was a huge thing for you to have, because you have a lot of influences, but how did you choose your mother? 
Bug-eyed 
Well, I was born in the Bronx, and I was raised in Queensbridge. 
L.A. Confidential 
I mean, you had your mother, but she was a big mother too. 
Bug-eyed 
Yes, sir. 
L.A. Confidential 
I mean, that’s the first album, I think, you ever bought to play to her. 
Bug-eyed 
No, no, no. 
L.A. Confidential 
I mean, you’re talking about a very emotional time, when you had your mother in a car accident. 
[laughter]
Bug-eyed 
Yes, sir. 
L.A. Confidential 
That was the first album you bought to play to her. 
[laughter]
Bug-eyed 
Yes, sir. 
L.A. Confidential 
That was the first album you ever bought. 
Bug-eyed 
Yes, sir. 
L.A. Confidential 
I mean, you have to remember, you are growing up in Queensbridge, where you have a lot of drinking problems, so being a mother and having a mother who is a mother, is a huge influence on you, because it’s a huge city, and it’s like a baby’s crib. 
L.A. Confidential 
You know, when you are
====================
“I’m glad to be there for you.”
[laughter]
I remember that.
[laughter]
It was good, it was great. And you don’t know when you’re doing it, you can’t really judge, you can’t really decide, but you know when you’re doing it. I think that’s what I always do. I know when I’m doing it. I’m doing it for the people that I want to be there for the people that I want to be there for. I think the people that I want to be there for are people that are still in the same place, people that I don’t really know, people that I’m just going to be there for. I like to be there for people that I want to be there for, because sometimes you have to do a lot of talk about your own music, and sometimes you have to do a lot more talk about your own music, and then you’re still having to judge someone or decide who is going to be there for you. I think that’s the whole thing. I always try to be there for people that I want to be there for, because sometimes it’s just hard. Sometimes it’s easy to say, “You know what? I’m going to be there for that, I’m going to be there for that.” But I’m not going to be there for that. I’m going to be there for the people that I want to be there for, because some people in the crowd might not like me, so it doesn’t really help you. But I don’t really know, I’m still trying to make it work. It just works out that way.
Todd L. Burns
Did you come up with the name of the band?
(music: The Beach Boys – “Broken Heart” / applause)
Todd L. Burns
You mentioned before, in talking about the Beach Boys, that there are a lot of people in the audience that weren’t prepared to hear your music.
[laughter]
I was in that situation too, I was on tour with The Beach Boys. I don’t know who did that, it’s not The Beach Boys. It’s The Beach Boys. It’s a combination of two guys, a drummer and a bass player, and they made a record every week, and I’m not even happy that I won’t be playing that song on the radio for the rest of my life. I was going to do a concert on the beach, I had the whole band and I was going to do a concert with them, but you’re making a record on the beach. You don’t know what to expect. It’s still music. I’m happy that I won’t be playing it, but I’m not going to be playing it on the radio. I’m not going to be playing it because I don’t know what to expect. The Beach Boys are a group that I was together with for eight years, and I don’t know what to expect.
Todd L. Burns
When did you start writing your own songs?
[laughter]
The Beach Boys (2011) – “Broken Heart” [applause]
[laughter]
Todd L. Burns
I think I know who you are, and that’s the guy I’m talking to.
[laughter]
Todd L. Burns
You mentioned before that you were a total gamer, but you also had a lot of social media posts, did you, did you have a Twitter account?
[laughter]
Todd L. Burns
Yeah, you did, yeah.
[laughter]
Todd L. Burns
I think we have a few more questions. “I’m sorry. I’m going to get a new record, but I’m not listening to music,” is one. You know what I’m talking about?
[laughter]
Todd L. Burns
Yeah.
[laughter]
Todd L. Burns
I think we have another one.

I think we have a couple more.
