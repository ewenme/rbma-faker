”She” is a member of a crew of musicians. It’s not that she doesn’t like pop music, but there’s a difference between pop music and electronic music. Those are two different things, and there’s a difference between listening to pop music and listening to Electronic Music. You can listen to electronic music and pop music, but that’s not the place to learn about electronic music. 
But I did listen to pop music, but I’m not a pop music fan. But if someone came to me and said, “Hey, I want to hear your record,” I would say, “Yeah, yeah.” I was like, “Really? What do you want?” Because it’s “pop” and it’s not electronic music, it’s more like jazz, it’s electronic, it’s very stuff. And I never listened to pop music. I was into jazz, but I never listened to pop music. 
And it’s the same with jazz, and I don’t know, I was like, “Oh, OK.” I’ve listened to jazz, but I was never into jazz. And I’m not going to go through the whole thing of what’s wrong with pop music, but I would say that pop music is used to sell records and it’s not really meant to be a soundtrack to anything else. It’s used to sell records. So the truth is, Pop Music is not meant to be used as a soundtrack to other genres. If you listen to pop music, you’re not going to hear any of the other genres that you hear in pop music. “I Want You Back” by The Band, for example, is not going to be used as a soundtrack to other genres.
Todd L. Burns
I want to know if you’re aware of any other artists that have added a soundtrack to their records? 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
No, I mean, I don’t know about that. I mean, when I was growing up in New York, I was not really into pop music. I was into jazz, but I was not into pop music. But now, when I come back home, I think that pop music is just too much of a commercial juggernaut. Pop music is not really meant to be a soundtrack to other genres. It’s not a soundtrack to jazz, it’s not a soundtrack to jazz, it’s not a soundtrack to other genres, it’s not a soundtrack to house or to other music. It’s just too big of a commercial juggernaut, and I don’t want to go through the whole thing of how to tell pop music apart from other genres. 
Todd L. Burns
What do you think about the cultural implications of pop music? 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
I mean, I think that pop music, for me, is just too big and that it’s not a soundtrack to other genres, it’s just too big, and I don’t want to go through the whole thing of pop music. 
Todd L. Burns
Did you meet anything? 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
Yes, I did. We were in San Francisco at the time. 
Todd L. Burns
And have you guys been in a studio together? 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
No,”cause I’m not that good. 
Todd L. Burns
So I’m wondering if you can share a little bit about the process of making a record, just to hopefully give people a sense of what it was like to work on a record? 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
[laughs] Yes, I wanted to know. 
Todd L. Burns
OK. So you’ve got a record out, and you’ve been working on it for a long time. You’ve been making records for a long time. How long have you been making them? 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
I’ve been in the studio for 18 years. 
Todd L. Burns
How long was that? 
Eothen “Egon” Alapatt
18.

What’s your real name?

Taylor Swift has been under fire for years, but there was a time, in the mid-’80s, when she was still a small-time music artist, when she wasn’t quite so famous as she is today, when she was more of a pop star.
In her 2014 Red Hot Chili Peppers concert at the Red Bull Music Academy, she said something that I can’t really put into words, but it was a little bit poignant, when she said she was going to quit making music and just go back to being a mom. 
I mean, you can be a supervillain and actually be a mother. I don’t know if you’re going to be a mother and a supervillain in the same thing, but if you’re going to be a mother, you have to do it all. It’s not necessarily good to be on the front line, but you have to do it.
I’m glad to have my daughter here, because the music industry has gone so far left, so far right, but I’m glad to have her in my life, because she’s making music, and she’s a mother, and she’s a rock star, and I’m going to have to learn to love her.
AUDIENCE MEMBER
I mean, you’re always like, “Oh yeah!” But you know, sometimes, that’s really the thing, that’s hard to do. I mean, I’m very open-minded, but I don’t want to do something, because I’m not open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be open-minded enough to be tolerant enough to be tolerant enough to be open-minded enough to be tolerant enough to be tolerant enough to be tolerant enough to be open-minded enough to be tolerant enough to be open-minded enough to be tolerant enough to be open-minded enough to be tolerant enough to be open-minded enough to be tolerant enough to be open-minded enough to be tolerant enough to be tolerant enough to be open-minded enough to be tolerant enough
AUDIENCE MEMBER
I mean, I think that you guys, for instance, talked a lot about how you got into that music industry, and I know you said you’ve heard some pretty terrible things, but I thought you guys were pretty nice, and I’ve heard about a lot of horrible shit, but you’re still open-minded enough to say, “I’m going to come out of the closet and not be part of this bullshit.”

”
(music: Change – “Change” / applause)
Pete Rock
I wish I had a record. I want you back, man. We’re gonna get you back.”
[laughter]
Did you guys have a story about the changes? Because we used to have a really bad record. Didn’t have a beat. You would go, “Why is that record called Change?” We had four or five different ones. We used to have a lot of records called “Change” and all the other
music we used to play. We would go, “We want Change back!” You know, we used to play “Change” all the time.
MARK KRAUSE
That was a lot of Change.
Pete Rock
Yeah, “Change” was a lot of Change, man.
MARK KRAUSE
We used to have a lot of Change.
Pete Rock
Yeah, we used to have a lot of Change.
MARK KRAUSE
Well, let’s get some of the mixtapes. 
Pete Rock
We knew the artists. We used to call them the Change, the Change.
MARK KRAUSE
All you've heard about Change and what he did, was he changed the sound of pop music forever. Change had an impact in the
music industry.
Pete Rock
Yeah, everybody used to call his records, “Change” and “Change” and it was a really huge hit. We used to call “Change” “Movement,” “Movement.” ’Cause, “Movement” was a hit, but it was a good record, but it was a good record, but it was not some big hit. “Change” was a hit record, but it was not a big hit, but it was a hit. “I Want You Back” was great, but “Change” was a hit record and “Movement” was a hit record, but “Change” was the big hit.
MARK KRAUSE
When you see the change in the history of music, that’s two things. One, it’s a hit record, two, it’s a record that’s going to be in people’ collections for a long time.
Pete Rock
Yeah, we used to play “Movement.” We had a lot of records called “Movement.” “I Want You Back” was the big hit, but “Change” was the big hit.
MARK KRAUSE
That was Pete Rock, “Movement” and “Change’ and “I Want You Back.”
Pete Rock
“I Want You Back” was a record that we used to play on the radio all the time. It was a hit record, but it was not a big hit. “Movement” was a hit record, but it was not a big hit. “I Want You Back” was a big hit record.
MARK KRAUSE
Right now, you know, when you watch the Change, you see a man that changed the game, because Pete Rock was the first man to take over the
music business and make it go into a new era, and change the game.
Pete Rock
Yeah.
MARK KRAUSE
And that’s why I think Pete Rock was so important to the music industry, the change. We used to call Change “Movement,” Movement, “I Want You Back,” “I Want You Back,” and “Change.”
Pete Rock
Yeah, and I know there’s a lot of people out there that’ll be like this. I know there’s a lot of people that want to make change happen. We used to put up Change, but we didn’t want to make Change, we wanted to make change happen. When we released our first album, “Slow Dance,” we used to call it “Change,” and it was a big hit, but it was not a big hit, but it was a big hit. We had our first record, “Movement,” and we released it and it was a hit record, but it was not a big hit, but it was a big hit, but we didn’t
====================
So, a couple of years ago when I was looking at the new albums of the year, I was really, really, really excited to see that they were going to feature a lot of new artists. I heard about Junot Diaz and all of a sudden I was in the right place at the right time. It was really, really cool. I was like, “OK, so they’re going to get the remixes, right?” And I did that. I went to Europe and I was like “OK, so I can do remixes.” And I’m like, “OK, so I can do the remixes.” And I did that. And now I was working at the time in my studio, and I was like “OK, so I can work at my own time.” And when I’m looking at the next albums, I’m like, “I can do remixes.” That’s what I’m here for, right? I’m looking at the old albums and I’m like, “Yeah, yeah.” But I always wanted to do remixes. I really wanted to do remixes. I had no idea. I just wanted to do remixes. So, I did that. And then I got to work with the label to do remixes, and I just started working with everyone. As soon as I got the label, I started doing remixes. It was all just about me doing remixes, doing remixes, doing remixes and then just putting it out there. And I was like, “Oh, OK, so now I can get the remixes out faster.” So, it worked out pretty good, right? So, I guess, it was just a matter of time. And I did remixes for all of them. And then at this point, I was looking at the Eastern Europeans, the Brazilians, the Turks, the Lebanese, the Tunisians, the Chinese, the African, the Middle Eastern. So, it was all about me doing remixes. And I was like, “Well, there’s not too much money coming out of you, but you’re doing great. OK?”
Audience Member 
I wanted to ask you about what you’re doing now, and might I share this with you? I heard you talk a lot about the album, and I wanted to know if you had a similar album?
El-P 
Yeah, I did. I do, I do remixes for old albums as well. And I do remixes for Rage Against the Machine albums, Metallica albums, like “Rage Against the Machine”. And I do remixes for a lot of other artists, too.
I do that for Mumford & Sons and a lot of other artists. I do remixes for Erykah Badu, for the XTC. I do remixes for Paul O’Connor, for Erykah Badu.
Audience Member 
I’m wondering if you have any music that you do, or do you have any in mind that you do?
El-P 
Oh, yeah, I do. I do remixes for all of them, yeah.
Mike Paradinas 
What was that about? I mean, you had a record coming out in the ‘80s, but nobody really took that and thought of it as something, because it was produced in New York and it wasn’t really influenced by New York music. It was just kind of like, “This is New York, this is New York.” So, I just did some remixes for it. And then we went to Europe and we did the remixes, and you know, we did them all with the same people.
I don’t know. I think the world is one of the most interesting places ever. I think it’s going to be an incredible place. It’s going to be a really interesting place. I think we’re definitely going to be on the cutting edge of it, and I think everyone’s going to be playing in Europe in the year 2013. It’s going to be... I think we’re going to be on the cutting edge of it. And I’m hoping that we’re just going to be in there and we’re just going to be doing the right things. I don’t want to do a song that’s too long, but I do want to do the right things.
That’s just how it is, you know? I’ve been in the best music business in the world, and I’m really excited. I’m excited to
====================
In the early days of the Internet, the speed of data access was the main thing that mattered. If you wanted a movie, you’re going to have to wait for a cable car, or you’re going to wait for an airplane. If you wanted your music on YouTube, you have to be on the phone with the radio station, or you have to wait for the mailman to pick up the package. The Internet made it possible for people to go from having to wait for a cable car, to having free Internet access.
In the early days of the Internet, there were others that had better connections, and people could do things that you couldn’t do on the Internet. If you wanted to send an email from your computer, you had to be on a daily ride to the post office. You had to wait for a package to arrive at your house. It was very simple once you had an Internet connection.
We are in the same situation today, of course, with people who can’t get in to a club, or not even get to the club, and they just send an email to a friend or a forum or whatever. They don’t have to go to clubs to do this. They just send it to you. If they really want to do something, they can. They’ll pay the station.
But let’s look at the other side of it, like what you’re doing right now, is you’re doing almost the same thing. You can’t have a radio station where everyone can go and play your records, or you can’t have a music store where you want to listen to a record you want to listen to. You can’t go to a music store and listen to a record you want to listen to. You can’t get rid of an album you just don’t like, or you can’t buy an album in a club. So you go to the Internet, and you can’t have both. You can’t have both at the same time. You have to play the records you want to listen to.
Audience Member
Yeah, I’m sure.
Todd L. Burns 
But you don’t have to sit around waiting for the mailman to pick up the package. You don’t have to wait for a radio station to pick you up. You can just go to the Internet. You don’t have to wait for a cable car to pick you up. You can just do it from your computer. I don’t think you have to wait for a mailman to pick you up.
Audience Member
What are you talking about?
Todd L. Burns 
I mean, there are some things you can do, and there are certain things that are just easier to do, but there are certain things that you can do, and you can take advantage of the Internet. You can go to the Internet, and you can go to a music store, and you can just play your records. If it’s not in the mail, it’s on the internet. There’s no delay. There’s no waiting for the mailman to pick you up, or the mailman to come and pick you up. There’s no waiting for the concert to start. You can just go to the internet and get it. You can go to a music store and play your records for free.
There are certain things, like when you use your computer, you can do some things that you can’t do on a computer, or you can go to the internet and do some things that you can’t do on a computer. But what you can do is do something that you can do on a computer, and that is all. You can do something on a computer, but just because you have a computer, it doesn’t mean it’s going to be your best work. If you have to wait for a cable car to pick you up, you don’t have to wait for the mailman to pick you up, you just have to wait for the music store to pick you up and bring it to you.
This is all part of what I was talking about, is that I have an iPod, I have an iPhone, I have a laptop, and I have a Twitter account. I can do things that a computer can do. I can do things that a computer can’t do. If you want to have a good experience on a computer, you have to go to the computer. If you want to have a good experience on a computer, you have to go to the computer. I think about that, because I use my computer all the time. I don’t use my real computer. I have my iPhone, my laptop, and I have Twitter.

We are going to change the world one hundred percent.” I had no problem at all, no problems in the studio, nothing, nothing. I was just like, “I’m going to do it my way.” When I got back in the studio, I got the idea that I was a queen of my generation and I was so happy.
I feel like that’s what the whole world wants to know, is that I’m a queen of my generation and I want to be queen of my generation. I want to be queen of the world. I want to be queen of the house. I want to be queen of the world, because it’s me and it’s me and I’m going to change the world. I don’t want to be a queen of me and it’s going to be me and I’m going to start a dynasty.

Audience member     
You’re calling yourself a queen of the house, but you’ve been doing that for so many years. How many people are in this room?
You’re called a queen of the house. You’re basically the queen of your generation and I’m not aware of anyone that isn’t a queen of the house.
You have no problem in the studio, in your life, no problems with the music industry. You’re going to change the whole world. You’re going to change the dancefloor world, because you’re going to change the whole music industry. You’re changing the whole industry, you’re changing the whole music industry. It’s like, “Dude, you got to do this.” I’m going to change the whole world, and I’m going to be the queen of my generation. I’m going to be the queen of my generation.

He’s not going to be 5.

He’s going to be 5, I think.

He’s going to be 5, so you know, I’m going to be the queen of my generation, ’cause I’m going to be in the spotlight. I’m going to be the queen of my generation.
You know, I’m going to change the whole world, man. I’m going to change the whole music industry, man. I’m going to change the whole music industry, because I’m going to change the whole industry.
Benji B    
You’re talking about your son, right?
Benji B    
He’s my son, he’s 4. I'm going to be the queen of my generation, I want to be the queen of my generation. You know what I’m saying? It’s going to be different for everyone. It’s going to be different for me, so I’m going to be a queen of my generation. It’s going to be different for my son but I’m going to be in the spotlight, I’m going to change the whole industry. It’s going to change the whole music industry. I’m going to change the whole music industry, and I’m going to be the queen of my generation.

Might as well try to work that out before you say that you’re going to make some music.

There you go.
A-Trak
OK. I’m going to play that track.

A-Trak
Yeah, it’s the same as the one you heard on the radio.

What was he talking about?
A-Trak
He was talking about that song.
Maurice Fulton
That’s my brother.
Gerd Janson
That’s your brother.
Murdock
Yeah.
Mack’ron
“I’m not going to be a rapper.”
A-Trak
That’s what he said. He said, “I’m not going to be a rapper.” I told him, “You’re not going to be a rapper.” I was like, “I don’t know.” I felt like the only thing I know is that if you want to be a rapper, you have to have a body. I don’t think he’s a rapper. I don’t think you’re going to be a rapper. You’re not going to be a rapper, you’re not going to be a rapper, you’re not going to be a rapper.” I don’t know if he made that up or if he did, but he was doing that for a long time and I thought, “Man, maybe he is right.” I’m not going to be the rap, but I’m going to be the artist. I’m an artist, but it’s not going to be like what he’s doing. I’m not going to be a rapper, but I’m going to be a producer, and that’s what I want to do.
Gerd Janson
I don’t know if you know but there was a time when you were on tour with these artists, people you worked with.
A-Trak
Yeah.
Gerd Janson
That was before you were on tour, right?
A-Trak
Yeah.
Gerd Janson
You said maybe you would have been on tour and you were there to the side and you’re doing your thing.
A-Trak
I was there to the side, but I was doing my thing. I was doing my music, but I was just in my studio and I just did my thing. I just had a drum kit and I just did my thing.
Maurice Fulton
I was always in my studio, I was always on the computer. I was always on the computer. I was just like, “This is what I am.” I was always in the studio. My brother was always in his studio, but I was just in my studio. I was just like, “This is what I am.” I was just in my studio. I was always in my studio. I was just doing my music, but I was in my studio. That’s what I wanted to do, because I didn’t want to be too big, but I wanted to be on the road, and I wanted to be a producer, and that’s what I wanted to do, and it was just a matter of what we had in our brains.
Gerd Janson
Well, we know you’re talking to the people that do you most, right?
A-Trak
Oh yeah.
Gerd Janson
So what was your influence?
A-Trak
I’m not talking to anyone, but I was listening to lots of old
stuff. I was listening to a lot of old hip-hop, and I was listening to old soul records. I was listening to old funk records. I was listening to a lot of music, but I was just listening to music, and I was listening to old stuff. I was listening to like “Gotta Get It,” or “The Innocents Are Coming,” and then I was listening to old stuff like that.
Maurice Fulton
That’s pretty much it.
A-Trak
That was my style.
MARK KIRK
I think that’s pretty much it, too. I think that was the influence.
A-Trak
That was my style.

See, it’s all about the music. It’s all about the music. All you gotta do is put your head down and just get on with it, is to work with the music that you are in front of. 
I was told about the fact that there is no show business, it’s all about the music, [and] you can do what you want with your money, you can be a DJ, you can be a producer, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, it can’t really hurt. It’s just about the music. And the music is the most important part of it, the drum machine, the bass, the bass, the keyboard, the tape, the song, the dancehall. It’s all about that. I
mean, I played at the Haus of Wives Club, and I’m in the studio with Soul Train. I was a dancer. And I was a dancer. And I was a professional dancer at the Haus of Wives Club. I was the only one in the whole club who was a professional dancer. I
was just like a dancer. I was a professional dancer. I was just the best. I was the best thing that ever happened to me, the best thing that ever happened to me, and I was blessed to be here. And I worked with Soul Train. And Soul Train was the best thing that ever happened to me, and I’m so happy. So happy. I’m just so happy to be here.

You mentioned that you were a dancer, and I was wondering, what were you doing at the time? What kind of dance?
Benny Sings 
[laughs] I was a dancer. I was a dancer at the Haus of Wives Club, and I was a dancer. And I was blessed to be here. And I was blessed to make it to this point in my life. And I always kept my heart open. I always had a smile on my face.
Emma Warren 
Do you have any questions or comments for Benny, or for the whole band?
Benny Sings 
[laughs] I don’t have any questions. I think I’ll have to do something to them.

That’s how it started. 
I was in a club called, of course, the Haus of Wives Club. And I was probably an exciting dancer. I was really, really excited about dancing, and I was very happy. I was happy when I was in the club. Because I was playing records. And I was the best dancer that I’d ever seen. And I was a good dancer. And that was my life, dancing. I was just happy, I was happy, I was happy, I was happy, I was happy. That was my life. 
I was in a club called the Haus of Wives Club at the time, and I was the best dancer that I’d ever seen. And I was blessed to be here, and I meant well. I mean, I was always well-behaved. I was always very nice to people, and I was always very nice to people. I was always very nice to people, and I was very, very happy. And the people that I met there, they were just so nice people, and they were so nice people, I always thought they would be. And I never thought, “Oh, is this a place where you can just be nice to everybody?” Because I was always into being nice to everybody, and being nice to people, and being nice to people, and being nice to people, and I meant well. And I was blessed to be here. I mean, I was blessed to be here. And I didn’t feel anything, I just felt this energy. I feel like I was blessed to be here at the Haus of Wives Club. And I mean, I was blessed to be there for the whole club, because I was blessed to be a dancer, because I was blessed to be there. And I was blessed to be here. And I was blessed to be here, and

Yeah, you’ve got a great story, but I think that one of the things that I think is really important is that you don’t sound like you’ve got a little world. You’re off on your own, you’re not the pied piper that you go clubbing and stuff. You’re a very introverted guy, and you don’t have to prove to anyone that you’re not a pied piper. You’re just a guy who won’t give a fuck if you show up at
one of his parties. You can come and you can do whatever you want. 
You’re just a guy that wants to set up, and if you want to do a dance, you know that you have to do it. I don’t know if you’re thinking of doing a dance, but if you do a dance, it’s not gonna be like that. You can do it, you can do it, but you’re not going to go to the club, and then suddenly you go to a club, and you want to do a dance and you’re like, “Wow, this is cool.” You know you’re not going to be able to do it. You get to the point where you’re like, “All right, maybe I can do it.” 
It’s not like you just go in and you get the kit, and then it’s just like, “Oh, fuck this.” It’s like, “OK, my shit, I’m not going to do that.” You know, you’re like, “Damn, I’m not going to do that.” You know, you’re like, “Oh, fuck it.” 
So the way you’re going to do it is, you’re going to do it, you’re going to do it at the club, and then you’re going to do it on your own. But it’s the same as if you do a concert and you go to a club, and you want to do it. You’re just going to do it on your own. 
Mark David 
I mean, if you wanna do it that way, you can, but it’s a different thing, and you’re talking about a different generation of people. It was a nice time to be young, and it’s really just about the fact that it’s not about how you look or how you look at something. It’s not about how you look to the people who are around you, it’s about how you feel. 
You know, if you’re a guy that you’re going to do something, you’re going to do it. You’re going to do it because your first thought is going to be, “What do I do?” And then if you’re a girl that you’re going to do it, you’re going to do it. You’re going to do it because you’re going to do it, and then you’re going to do it on your own. 
It’s really the same with getting into a band, you listen to the record and you just want to do it. It’s not that you’re going to be kicked out if you try to do something. It’s just you’re going to do it on your own, and then if you want to do it, you’re going to do it. If you want to do it, it’s just you. 
Yeah, Mark, I know the thing, I know everybody’s got the same thing. I’ve heard it as well. I’ve been around too long, and I’ve seen too many times, and I know people do it, but I’ve been through it, and I know what it means. 
If you’re a girl that you’re going to do it, you have to be like, “OK, let’s do it.” If you’re a guy that you’re going to do it, you have to be like, “Alright, can you get the right girl?” And if you want to do it… 
If someone said, “You know, we think you’re going to do it,” and you say, “Oh, OK,” and you do it, it’s

I don’t think anyone here has ever seen a train, a train that is so full of cars, with so many people on it, that you’re like, “OK, I don’t think this is a train.” I don’t think anybody here has ever seen a train, I mean, I were in New York, there was the Javits, there was the Chrysler, and I think they had a train that was so full of cars that you could drive into the other train.

====================
Spanning a series of films, from the early days of London, to the rise of the Internet and the birth of independent film, there is a reshuffling of the genre. From no longer being a genre and being, in fact, completely a sub-genre, you’ve become totally unheard of, with the exception of the very famous British shows. And that’s going to be the case for a long time, because a lot of people, when we talk about London, they think of it as a ... [inaudible] ... I mean, it’s a city that’s the home of fashion, now it’s responsible for fashion. And they don’t really know what to do with it. They really don’t even know what to call it. But at the same time, there’s got to be a concerted effort to make it the third most important city in the world.
It’s got to be a place that’s not just a little commercial, top-down business. It’s got to be a place where people want to live, there’s got to be a lot of people that want to live here, and there’s got to be a lot of people that want to work in London and move there and live there. It’s got to be a place where you can’t just go there and take a job and then be at home. You have to be on the road. You have to get your family in, and you have to have a job and then you can get to work. And, you know, you’re not going to be a very good home. You’re not going to be a great family, but you have to figure out what you’re doing. And so, you know, and that’s why I’m so proud of London, is because over the years, a lot of people in the UK have moved to New York, and they’ve been there for two years, and it’s been a very nice experience. And I think that’s the biggest thing that I’ve ever done was do a film, an independent film, and it’s been the biggest movie I’ve ever done.
Rod Serling
And I’m not doing it to sit there and be nice. I’m doing it to help people. I’m doing it to help people.
Audience Member
I’m actually a bit of a music fan.
Rod Serling
Yeah, I’m a music fan. And I’m here to tell you, one of the biggest problems in London is that, despite having the most creative culture in the world, there’s not a lot of people that want to actually be part of it, and they get bored. And so, for me, it’s been very good to just do something that’s not really really known. And then I think that the other thing is, I think Londoners, they’ll be over it eventually, but you know, I’ve been coming here for years, and I’ve always had a great experience. I think that’s what will always keep me here.
And I think that the biggest thing about England is that you can’t really take anything away from the culture. You can’t do anything to take away the culture, but you can take away the music, and I feel like that’s what keeps me here. I can’t turn it off, but I can take whatever I want. I can take different things, and I’ve got to do what I want to do. And that’s what keeps me here. And I think that’s the biggest thing about London.
Audience Member    
Hi, I just had an interesting question about the English dubstep scene. If you can, maybe you can just play a bit of that.
Rod Serling
Yeah, sure.
Audience Member    
Well, it’s not like the US, it’s not like Canada, it’s not like Europe, it’s not like Latin America. It’s not like America, it’s not like Australia. And you’re living in the UK, England, and you’re getting a lot of different things.
Rod Serling
I’ve always been around there, and I’ve done some music. I’ve been there, and I’ve done some music. My music is like, if you want to do a rave in London, you can do it, but if you want to do a rave in New York, you can do
====================
The new wave of electronic music is pushing the boundaries of what we can do with synthesizers, so we’re here to help. We’re not engineers, we’re just music nerds, so we’ll be introducing you to the latest and greatest in technology, so you can be up to speed and ready for the next wave.
Emma Warren    
Well, can you tell us a little bit about your background?
Rafael    
I’m mostly from Philadelphia, so I’m very old-school, which is what I’m here for. I don’t know how to explain it, but I’m from Philly, and I’m really into Philadelphia. I’m from Philadelphia, and I’m the first one to buy a Roland TR-808. I bought a Roland TR-909, and I put a lot of money into it. I was the first one to buy a Roland TR-909. I bought the Roland TR-7000, and I was into the Roland TR-909. I was into the Roland TR-1000, and I was into the Roland TR-1100. I was into the Roland TR-1200, and I was into all this stuff. 
Emma Warren    
OK, let’s just play a couple of tracks from the new wave, which is like a little track, and then we can talk about what you’re doing now, and also the way you’re able to do this kind of music, and how it’s different to what you’re doing now, which is for the most part, not being a technical artist. So you’re just just a music nerd, right?
Rafael    
Yeah, I mean, I’m doing my work, but I’m also doing other stuff, like I’m a full-time composer and a full-time musician, and I’m not into the technical stuff. But I have a professional background of making music professionally, so I know what I’m doing and can do my own stuff. I’m not going to just be like, “This is what I’m going to do, and this is what I’m going to do,” because I don’t know how to explain it, but I know what I’m doing. 
Emma Warren    
So what were you thinking when you were making that music?
Rafael    
That was my whole life, and it’s not like I just give it away, it’s my whole thing. I don’t know why it started, but I just wanted to do it, and I just wanted to do it. I’m not looking to be like, “Oh, I’m going to be a prude,” because I don’t know, I just want to do it and I just want to do it. I’m not trying to be like, “I’m going to be like this, I’m going to be a pornographer,” because I don’t know, I just want to do it. I want to be a musician, and I want to be a producer, and I want to be a DJ. 
Emma Warren    
That is what I think.
Rafael    
Yeah. 
Emma Warren    
Now, you are also releasing records on your own label, so obviously you have a lot of choices for what you want to do with your own stuff. You have a lot of different labels now, which is nice.
Rafael    
Yeah, I’m doing my own stuff. I’m not going to go back to Pro Tools. I want to do my own stuff, and I’ll do it on my own label, because it’s a lot cheaper than going to a big studio, and there’s more freedom. I think it’s more important to do it on your own label, because I want to see my music respected, and it’s not going to be taken down. I want to see my music respected and I want to see that money. It’s important to do that, because if you’re just going to just go to a big studio, you’re going to lose money. It’s not going to work for your music. It’s not going to work for your money, it’s going to work for the record, and you’re not going to get paid for it. So you have to

Hanna Bächer 
So, to start this in a deadpan way, I wanted to ask you about the Chicago music scene, because Chicago is a very interesting city. It’s a city that has produced some of the greatest music, but I think there’s a perception that it’s a very violent city, a city that’s an urban jungle, a city that’s not in the right shape for anything, but it’s a city that has been around a long time and it’s a city that’s always been a part of your life.
Todd L. Burns 
Absolutely, it’s a city.
Hanna Bächer 
I mean, there’s a lot of things going on. But there are a few things that we could talk about. The first thing is the music business. There was a lot of people that had had a hit record, and then they’d be like, “What’s the deal with this record?” It was coming off an album and a little bit of a hit record, and then it would be like, “Oh, God, I love this record!” “Fame will come on!” “Let’s make this hit record!” “Fame will come on!” And then the record would go out, and then the record would go out and then the record would be like, “This record is so cool, I’m going to go to the studio and do my album,” then the record would be like, “Let’s work on something else,” and then the record would be like, “I don’t have an album, it’s too long, I’m not going to make a record.” And then the record would be like… “Oh, I want to do another record,” then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record was like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “I want to do another record,” then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “Oh, okay.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “I’m going to do another record.” Then the record would be like, “I want to do another record.” Then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would be like, “This record is so cool, I want to do an album with this record.” And then the record would be like, “I want to do another record,” then the record would come out, and then the record would be, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “This record is so cool, I want to do another record with this record.” Then the record would be like, “I want to do another record,” and then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would come out, and then the record would be like, “Oh, OK.” Then the record would be like, “I want to do another record, and then the record would be, “Oh, OK.”
Todd L. Burns 
You’re in two different places in your career, being a producer and being a DJ.
Hanna Bächer 
Actually, I don’t know if you know the name Lord Has No Clothes! What’s that?
Todd L. Burns 
“Lord Has No Clothes?”
Hanna Bächer 
“Lord Has No Clothes!”
Todd L. Burns 
So that’s where you are, in a club.

====================
There’s been a lot of people this week, I mean I’ve been talking about this with them. And you know, I’m a fan. I’m into the guy. I like the guy, so I think you could do the same thing. You know, you can do the same thing. And there’s been a lot of people…
John Scofield
I have a question. You mentioned, you said, “I like the guy, I’m not going to do a record for them.” Well, why don’t you come back, it sounds like a good idea, but just the fact that I'm writing about the guy, I in my opinion, should get to the point. And you know, I don’t want to be a big roll of the dice with a record, you know? I think it’s just marketing, but I do want to be honest about the guy. Because you know, I don’t know about the hooking up or anything. And then you know, you’re looking at the card. You know, “Oh, here’s another guy, he’s got a bit of a hook up.” You know, “Oh, yeah, I’ve got a record for that guy.” You know, it’s the fact that the guy’s got a good name and he’s got a good name. So I’m looking at him like, “How come he got all this media attention, how come people really love him?” I’m looking at it like, “Oh, that guy was great, OK.” You know? But I think it’s telling that, yeah, you know, he’s got a good name, he’s got a good name, and he’s got a good music scene. I think he’s got a good following, and he’s got a good MC, and he’s got a good label and he’s a good DJ. And if you want to do a record for him, is it just a case of, “Do your record for him,” or is it something else? I think it’s all, “do your record for him,” because it’s really, “Yes.”
Audience Member 
I feel like I’m a bit of a bad influence, but I’m also not a bad person? Is it just that you’re a fan or that you think you’re a bad influence on someone?
John Scofield
I think you’re right, you know? You can become a bad influence, you know? My problem is, I don’t know how many people I’ve seen that have done records for them and they’ve done good records. I’ve seen people doing records for the boys from the UK, but they’ve done great records. I don’t think they’re always anything but great. I know I’ve seen people doing this and that as well. I think people can’t get enough of the guy, and if you can’t get enough of the guy, then you’re going to have a problem. I’ve got a lot of people I’ve seen doing records for people who I know they’re a bad influence in their life, but then I’m watching them and I’m thinking, “Well, you know, I don’t like that record, but I’m going to do something for them, and I’ve got my label and I’m going to do my record for them,” or whatever. 
People that I know, they’ve made records for people, have been on an album, they’ve done records. They’ve been good to me, and I’ve been very good to them. And I’m not giving them any money, I’m giving them a record, and I’m going to do it. They’re going to do their record, the record will come out, it’s going to be good, it’s going to be good, and then they’ll ask me to do another record for them. And I’m going to do it. And then you don’t have to deal with the money. I think the thing to me is you can’t just walk away from a record. I think that’s the biggest thing, that’s the thing that people have to understand. When you buy a record,
====================
Bigger is more
cool.
Audience Member 
You’ll get tired of this. What is it about compact... You don’t like to be in the spotlight, but obviously, I think, right now, compact is very
important, compact is the way, compact is the way to go. So, why don’t we have
another meeting of the compact guys, and you are not going to have to work in a way to get
compact. You can do this meeting in a hotel, or you can go to the convention in a hotel. We do it
in the convention center, but it’s not the same as what it is now, the compact guys and
the big guys in the hotel is in the convention center. If you see the big guys, they have
compact. If you see the small guys, they don’t have compact. They have... I don’t know, you get a
good idea if you want to marry them. I’m not giving you a compact because I’m not
going to get involved in it. I’m not going to try to mingle and get them to be a
package, so it’s not like you’re getting them to be a package because that’s not
anything you can do. It’s like this, they are not in the spotlight, they’re not
getting the recognition, they’re not getting the attention. They are not getting big press, they
are not getting famous, they are not getting any big money. They are not getting big promotions,
they are not getting any benefits, they are not getting any sign of getting big money, they’re
not getting anything special, they are not getting any recognition, they’re not getting any
sign of being able to do anything special. It’s like, you’re not going to get anything special
with your music if you’re not in the spotlight. That’s not going to happen, the people
are going to judge them, they’re not going to see what you got on the couch or on stage. They’re
going to look at you for what you got on the couch, and they’re going to see what you got on the
stage. Until then, they’re going to judge you. So, why don’t we get those two
compact guys together and I’m going to tell you what I think about it. I think it’s
good that you can be in a hotel and you can eat, you can go to the gym, you can do all that. It’s good
that you can have a choice of staying in a hotel or going to the gym. It’s good to be in
a hotel, but why don’t we just have the big guys, the big guys in the hotel? We
don’t need to change the names. We just need to get the big guys in the hotel.
I think we could do it. It’s a good way to get them to have that power, even though
they have smaller rooms, they have bigger rooms, but it’s a good way to get them to feel
that power. It’s a good way to get them to feel that power.
The next question I think is, I’m always going to play the radio station, I’m always going to play the
music I think is good or if the thing is going to be great, or if the music is going to be
great, it’s going to be here on the radio. If they have a radio show, we can
play the radio station. Sometimes you have to change the names. We always have to
change the names, but we also have to change the music. It’s a
good way to do it, but it’s also a dangerous thing. You have to be in the
artists, it’s a great way to get artists, but you have to be in the
artists, you have to be in the artists, you have to be in the people, you have to be
in the shop owners, you have to be in the hotel owners, you have to be in the
people who are listening to your music, and you have to be in the selling, you have to
be in the buying, you have to be in the going to the movie theater, you have to
be in the buying, you have to be the sales people, the buying people, you have to
be the buying people, you have to be the buying people, the buying.
That’s the big picture, how you get the people to listen
====================
”We gonna get a fader,” we played it and it was like, “Oh, this is meant for radio, this is meant for TV (laughs).” And I was like, “I don’t know what you mean, but I don’t want to hear that again.”
Aaron Gonsher
You were in the studio in the studio, it was like, “Well, you did a record, you did a record.” And I said, “Yeah, you did a record.” And we thought, “Well, maybe this song is gonna do the same thing.” And maybe that’s it. We did a record and it didn’t sell, we did another record, and it did sell.
NICK DWYER
I think that song is gonna be out in the fall. And then I have the other record, “Goddamnit,” off of that album, and I’m gonna put it out in the fall, and then I’m gonna play it to you guys at the festival.”
(music: The Flaming Lips – “Goddamnit” / applause)
NICK DWYER
I think it’s been a pretty big one, because it was for the first time on the radio in a big scale, and it was a big hit. And that was the first record that we released, and it got played at number one. It was like a huge hit. And then we did a record, “I Can’t Feel My Face,” off of that album, and we released it on the label, Ace of Base. And then we did another record, “What a Wonderful World,” off of that album, and Ace of Base released it on the label. And then we did another record, “Wake Up,” off of the record “Goddamnit,” off of the album “I Can’t Feel My Face,” off of the record “Wake Up,” and it was one of the biggest records ever, and we did another record, “Crisis,” off of that album. And then we did another record, “Chorale,” off of that album. And I don’t know what you thought of that, but really it was a big hit.
And then I thought, “We got a TV show, we got a TV show, we got a radio show, and we got a record…” And it was a big hit, and then we did a record, “The Flaming Lips.” I said, “We got a TV show, we got a radio show, and we got a record.” And it was like that. And then we did a record, “Goddamnit,” off of that album. So we did three records in a row, and that was as far as it got.
Aaron Gonsher
There’s a story that Chris Blackwell told you about you and your family, and he said, “Well, you know, Chris, we’re gonna get a florist, and we’re gonna do a florist.” And he was like, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.” And I was just like, “Oh, no! No, no, no!”
NICK DWYER
It’s a very kind thing, and it’s very nice, but it’s not like you’re the right person for it. You know what I mean? You know, you can’t just put yourself out there and try it, you know what I’m saying?
AUDIENCE MEMBER
I was just wondering, what was your relationship with Chris Blackwell like, when you were young?
NICK DWYER
We’re all brothers. We’re all huge fans, and I think that Chris is very special in the sense that we’re all fans of music, and he’s a friend, and we’re all fans of music, and we’ve all been together for eight, nine years. I mean, he’s the first to get credited as the producer of “The Flaming Lips”.... I think he’s the producer of “The Flaming Lips”. He’s the first to get credited as the producer of “Goddamnit.” And he’s the first to get credited as the producer of “Crisis.”
I think that’s it, you know

Ricky Martin, “Swerve”
Bonus Track
[music: Zay – “Swerve”] 
[music: Zay – “Swerve”] 
Zay “Swerve” is an extreme rap, the first made by an artist to have more than one album, and the one that everyone knows. 
In this track, Zay raps on fast-paced beats, with a deep, psychedelic bassline that is the heart of Zay “swerve.” The result is a record that may be considered his most popular album to date, and one that he is still pulling away from the dancefloor. 
In his lecture at the TED conference this week, he talked about his upbringing in Atlanta, his early rap career, and the importance of DJing to him. 
Audience member   
Hi, I’m from Atlanta. And I think this is my first question. You were talking about your upbringing, how many people were in the house?
Zay 
Actually, I’m in the same house, but my mom is from Indianapolis, Indiana, and my dad is from Chicago. I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood, where there was a lot of hustling, and then when I was young I used to play music. I used to get my music picked up at the local church. My mom would rock out to her favorite records. My dad would play favorites. My mom’s going to sing along to her favorite records. 
My little brother was a huge concert pianist, and my little sister was a huge concert violinist, and I was always into music. And then we used to go to the local club, and I used to play with my little brother in the booth. My buddy was the best, he was always known to be a good DJ. When I was 12, I would be a DJ, and then when I was 14, I would be a guitar player. 
In the early ‘90s, I would go to college and play drums, and then I would go to the club and play bass, and then I would go to the college and play guitar, and then I would go to college and play drums. And then I would go to college and play guitar, and then I would go to college and play drums. 
Then I would go to college and play cello, and then I would go to college and play guitar, and then we would go to college and play drums. 
But we never had a lot of money, so we didn’t have a lot of equipment, so we used to do all of our schoolwork out of the car. That’s how we got our records, they came out of the car. I could buy a new radio every year, and it took a lot of times, because the radio was so cheap, and the kids would drive around to school and buy them. 
But we were just kids, so we could get the records. We could get up and play a record, and then we could go back to school. But we didn’t have the equipment, so we would go to the college and buy the equipment. That’s how we got our records. 
But all of these people were in jail, and they used to mess me up. I would always be in the car, so the kids would mess up their cars, and then I would go to the college, buy the equipment, buy the records, and they would even give me a little gift. 
But we never had the equipment, so we would just get a little gift, and then we would go back to school, and then they would mess up. 

====================
University of Virginia is one of the most popular universities in America. The school has been in existence for more than 70 years and it has had more than 300 students in the past.
The school is known as the University of Virginia. It is located in Charlottesville and it has been a very interesting university for a long time. It is an impressive university. It is the birthplace of the American dream. It is a place where you can do anything and everybody has to be happy. It is a place where you have to be proud of yourself. It is like the beginning of the end of the world.
There are so many things that I like about this university. I think that there is such a strong emphasis that I want to show people that there is so much more to life than what you get out of your university education. It is a university that has been there since 1887. All of these years, we were at college and we were all doing college and we were all getting a degree. We were doing college just to learn about music and we were doing college to learn about math and we were just learning about physics and we were just learning about everything. We were just learning about the environment too. We were learning all of these things. We were just learning about our families. We were just learning about our friends. We were just learning about how to do this. We were just learning all of these things. I love this university. I love the fact that I have had a chance to be on a campus where I have been able to be in leadership positions for my entire life and I have been able to be able to do all of this just by being a student at this university, because it is just so supportive. I have had so many opportunities to be in leadership positions, because we were in a university for so many years. We were in a space where we had so many different types of opportunities to be able to do this.

I have a question. What is the average student? 
Robert Fripp 
The average student is about 12 years old. The average student is five years old. We are all very excited for the future. We are all very excited about our future. We are all excited about the future. That is the real question. What is going to happen with this university? I think what is going to happen is that I think we will be able to provide a college for the student body, a community college for the student body, a high school for the student body, a second grade school for the student body, with the same kind of programs that we have here. In a way, we are going to be able to do all of that, because we will be able to provide these programs to the student body, because we are going to be able to do all of these programs. We are going to be able to provide a social service center, to the seniors, because we are going to be able to provide a meeting room, to the nursing homes and the long-term care providers and the people that we want to support in the community, all of these kinds of things. All of these different kinds of programs that we have here, which is really what this campus is about. It is about community and being able to have a place where you can be a part of that community. It is about having access to all of these different types of facilities, so that you can be able to have these types of programs that are going to help you achieve your goals and your aspirations. It is about having a sense of self, so that you will be able to do what you want to do. It is about having a sense of self, so that you will be able to do what you want to do. Your dreams will come true.
I think what we are going to be able to do is we are going to be able to provide a college for the student body, and we are going to be able to provide a social service center, and we are going to be able to provide a meeting room, so that you can have a space where you can be a part of the community, where you can be able to be in a role as a parent, so that you can be able to be here and be our guest speaker, and we are going to be able to provide a meeting room, so that you can be a part of that. I think that will be really, really powerful in terms of what we can do.
You can be also a part of it, because we are going to be able to provide these programs to the community, which is going to be really a great thing. We are going to be able to provide you with childcare, because it will be a great thing for you. We have a number of different programs that will be available to you, and we are also going to be able to provide you with housing, because you are going to be able to be right here, where you can be a part of this community. If you

a lot, really. Because I was a pretty good singer, and I played, I just had a lot of talent in me. I’m a good singer, I know what I’m doing. I know when I do my next record, I’m going to be able to sing better than people have ever heard me. I know I’m going to be able to do better than people have ever heard me do it.
I can sing better than people have ever heard me do it. It’s not really that I can sing better than people that I have heard. It just comes down to how I feel and what I want to do. I like to do records that I feel good about, and then I want to do records that people want to buy because they’ll be excited about bigger records. I want to do records that people want to buy because they’ve had their experience with other versions, because they know that I mean well. I’m not going to do big records that people have never heard before, but I’m not going to do some big records that people have heard before. I mean, I’m going to do some big records, and I think I’m going to do some big records. I want to do some big records. I just want to do it.
Audience member
The last time I did an album, I did a record for Public Enemy, and I was on tour with them, and I was on the Main Stage. People said that I sounded like I was on tour. I was on the Main Stage. I was on the Main Stage with Public Enemy. I was on the Main Stage with Public Enemy. I was on the Main Stage, and I was on the Main Stage with Public Enemy. I was on the Main Stage, with Public Enemy, and I was on the Main Stage, with Public Enemy. I was on the Main Stage with Public Enemy, and I was on the Main Stage, with Public Enemy. I didn’t know what to expect, but I was happy to be there. I wanted to be able to do something that people wanted to buy, and I wanted to do a record that people wanted to buy, because they’ll be excited about bigger records, and they’ll be excited about bigger records. I don’t want to do a record that people want to buy, because that’s going to be too big, and they’ll be disappointed about it. I want to be able to do something that people want to buy, because they’ll be excited about bigger records. I want to do a record that people want to buy because they’ll want to buy a bigger record. That’s the way I want to do it.
MARK
You said that you were in the studio with Public Enemy. Are you still in the studio with them now?
Sacha Jenkins
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARK
I want to go back to your first question, which is, after about the second album, did you find that you could do it better, as far as what you wanted to do, than people did?
Sacha Jenkins
Nah, I mean, that’s why I went to the studio with them. They’re a good band, and they’re a good band. I wanted to do it better, but I just wanted to do it. I wanted to do it better, but I didn’t want to do it better, than people had done it. I wanted to do it better than people could do it.
MARK
You also said that you started the band and you were the drummer when you were in high school, and you started the band, and then you went to college. Did you go to college or did you go to college and study music?
Sacha Jenkins
No, I never went to college, because I didn’t want to go to college. I just didn’t want to go to college. I was always in high school, but I didn’t want to go to college, because I wanted to be an artist and I wanted to be an artist. I wanted to be an artist, and I wanted to be in the studio. I wanted to be a musician. I wanted to be something, and I wanted to be the best I could be, but I wanted to be something. I wanted to be a singer.

====================
Right now I’m doing some work with my band, one of these projects is called “English House.” We do a lot of records in English houses, which is kind of cool.
Nick Dwyer
You know, in the beginning, you were talking about the importance of capturing the essence of everyone, and what would you do to make sure that the people who listened to your records, who really loved it, really understood what you were doing.
Dave Smith
I could tell you about things, but I could give you, what I would do, and what I would say to the people who are listening to us is that I would tell you what I was thinking, and I would tell them what I would do. I would tell them what I would do to make sure that this record would be remembered, and I would tell you what I was thinking. I would tell you what I would do.
Nick Dwyer
That was a good way to start.
Dave Smith
Right. We were talking about that earlier. We were talking about this album, at the time I was radio-ready, because that’s what we wanted to do, this album was Radio Shack, not Reverb, it was Radio Shack, so we wanted to be sent out to radio stations and we wanted to be on the streets, right? We wanted to be on the streets, and we wanted to be on the streets, and we wanted to be cool. I would tell you what I was thinking, and I would tell you what I would do.
Nick Dwyer
You know, just to get to the album that you mentioned earlier, you mentioned it was like an album for people who didn’t like the remixes that came out by the label. You said that you had this idea of your albums, the essence of your music, your band. Were you listening to them?
Dave Smith
Yeah, I would listen to it.
Nick Dwyer
OK, that’s cool.
Dave Smith
Yeah, I would listen to it.
Nick Dwyer
I think this is something that you’re doing now, you’re not a DJ, you’re a musician, you’re a producer, and you’re a musician. You had all the right people in the right places at the right time.
Dave Smith
I would never have wanted to be a producer, I never wanted to be a DJ. I don’t know, I just wanted to be a producer, and that’s it, that’s it.    
Nick Dwyer
Did you feel like you were doing anything special in that sense, that you weren’t just doing the same old, standard, samey stuff that everyone else was doing?
Dave Smith
No, I just wanted to be able to do cool, and I wanted to be able to be kind of unique, because I wanted to be able to do something different, and I wanted to be able to do something really exciting. I wanted to be able to do something new, because I wanted to do something new, and I just wanted to do something different.
Nick Dwyer
So in the early days, you were producing tracks that were very unique, and perhaps you can talk more about your experience with the late “Chuck N Save” record, because it’s very close to that, but the Chuck N Save record, I mean, it was very much a classic record, I mean it was very popular.
Dave Smith
Yeah, it had a lot of people on the label, and it was one of the songs that I heard, and it was very catchy, and it was good, I love that record, I love that record, everybody loves that record.
Nick Dwyer
Where did it come from, ultimately?
Dave Smith
It came from Chuck N Save, it was Chuck N Save, and I was a big fan of Chuck N Save, and I was a big fan of Chuck N Save. I was just in love with Chuck N Save.
Nick Dwyer
How did you feel about having a band that was on Reverb and your label, but that was also on Reverb, that you couldn’t get to sell records to?
Dave Smith
I hated it because Reverb had all the hottest DJs, they were really hot, and Chuck N Save was on Reverb, and I was playing Reverb. I would always play Reverb, and then I would tell people I was Chuck N Save. I would play Chuck N Save on Reverb.
Nick Dwyer
Chuck N Save also had a lot of people, right?
Dave Smith
Yeah, and they were all cool, and they were doing their thing, and we were doing ours, and I was kind of in love with them, but they were not living up to
