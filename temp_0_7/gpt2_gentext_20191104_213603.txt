Horny MILF, you have to have this, I am the one who is talking dirty with you.
Audience member 
Yeah, the guy who is the biggest in the world, I never fucked him, if that helps.
Horny MILF 
I’m talking dirty with him because he’s my boyfriend and I can be mean to him.
Tony Hawk
It’s funny because you care about him. It’s a good thing I’m a man because you’re not going to get away with anything. You’re not going to get out. I’m going to hurt him and if I’m not going to hurt him, then maybe somebody else will.
Audience member
You have to be nice to him, you have to be nice to your friends. I’m not going to hurt him, if it’s not bad. I’m going to hurt him.
Tony Hawk
I’m not going to hurt him. I’m going to hurt him and if I’m not going to hurt him, then maybe somebody else will. I mean, I’m not going to hurt the guy, if he’s not going to hurt the girl. I’m going to hurt him.
Tony Hawk
If he’s not going to hurt him, then it’s not a big deal. If he does hurt me, then I’m not going to hurt him. If he’s going to hurt me, then I’m going to hurt him. That’s what I’m doing. I’m going to hurt him. If I’m not going to hurt him, then somebody else is going to.
Audience member
I never talked to him in the shop. I never talked to him in the club. I never talked to him. I never talked to him. It got to be a name. I never talked to him in the shop, and I never talked to him in the club, and I never talked to him in the club.
Tony Hawk
I don’t know. I mean, I’ve been to clubs, I was in clubs. I was in clubs. I used to go to clubs, I was in clubs. I was always in the club. That’s all I ever really did was go out there. I went out and I went to the club. I never went to the club. I never went to the clubs, I never went to the clubs.
Tony Hawk
I think that was the only time I ever went to the club. I wasn’t going to go to clubs, I wasn’t going to go to clubs, I wasn’t going to go to clubs. I never went to clubs. I avoided clubs. I was never going to go to clubs, I never went to clubs. I was never going to go to clubs. I was never going to go to clubs. I used to go to Wal-Mart, I used to go to Wal-Mart, I used to go to Wal-Mart, I used to shop at Wal-Mart. I was never going to go to Wal-Mart, I never went to Wal-Mart, I never went to Wal-Mart. I would never go to Wal-Mart, if I was going to go to Wal-Mart. I never went to Wal-Mart, if I was going to go to Wal-Mart.
Tony Hawk
I was always in the club. I was always in the club. It was on the second floor, and I used to go there. I would go there and I would see the posse. I used to go to the posse, and I used to have a lot of this girl, this girl called Liza, Liza, she’s got her hair done, she’s got her hair done, she’s got her hair done. I never went to the posse. I never went to the posse. I never went to Wal-Mart. I never went to Wal-Mart, if I was going to go to Wal-Mart, I never went to Wal-Mart.
Tony Hawk
The only time I ever went to the club was to get the first song with “Lazy Bones”, so that was my first song with the posse. I never went to the club, unless I was going to go to Wal-Mart. I never went to Wal-Mart, if I was going to go to Wal-Mart. I never went to Wal-Mart, if I was going to go to Wal-Mart.
Tony Hawk
I don’t know, I was never going to the club. I never saw the posse, unless I was going to go
====================
So you can go back and forth over a period of time, you can do things, you can mix, and you can do that with an MPC. But there’s a certain feeling that’s in the music that’s trying to get you, to have a computer that’s not the same as your guitar, or your bass, or your drums. But it’s trying to make you feel like you can do something. Which is really what it does, is kind of make you feel like you can do something.
NICK DWYER
I think that’s kind of a good theme to follow, that’s really what it is, is that all of a sudden, a computer, you can do stuff. But at the same time, it’s an instrument that’s not exactly the same as a guitar or a bass or drums. A lot of people, it’s not just the same thing. You can do a mix or you can do a direct-to-DVD, or you can do some kinds of programming. But it’s still a computer, it’s still a digital interface that’s going to be able to do a lot of things. But at the end of the day, you’re still listening to your music. You’re still understanding what it means to you, and it’s still a little bit of an instrument, but at the same time, it’s still making you feel like you can do something.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I think that’s a perfect example of the idea of the technology, the technology, has a like a chip, it’s got a processor. It’s got a RAM, it’s got a hard drive, it’s got a processor. You can do a lot. But the point that I was trying to make was that computers, it’s an interface, it’s not a real console. It’s a little bit like an iPod, a little bit like a VCR. But it’s still a computer, it’s still giving you the ability to do certain things.
NICK DWYER
I think that’s exactly what it is, it’s a device that’s not just a real console, it’s also a little bit more like an iPod. It’s a little bit more like an iPod. It’s got a little bit more of a personality, because it still has creative capabilities. There’s a certain personality that goes along with the technology. But at the same time, it’s not real, it’s still a computer, it’s still an interface, and it’s still a digital device. It’s still a computer, it’s still a computer, it’s got a personality. It’s still a little bit more of a creature than a real console, and it’s still a device that’s not totally the same as a console.
So I think it’s a good example of the idea of the technology, the technology, has a personality, and it’s not a real console, it’s not like a real console. It’s got a personality. It’s got qualities that make it different. It’s got a personality, it’s got a little bit of a personality. It’s got some of the same qualities that you’d get from an actual console, but it’s got a different attitude to it, and it’s got a different personality, and it’s got different capabilities. To me, it was a little more than a real console. It was a little bit more like a VCR. It was a little bit more like an iPod. It was a little bit more real, it was a little bit more like a VCR. So it was a bit different, and I think it’s a good example, like I said, it’s a big difference between a real console and a VCR, it’s like a difference of personality and a different capability.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I believe that you also have a different philosophy from that of people from certain eras, and from like ‘80s, like Ableton or Ableton Pro. For example, perhaps now, you’ve got Ableton Pro, Ableton Live, that you can do a lot of things, but what about that era, where you guys were on Ableton Live. Could you explain to us a little bit about what Ableton Live is?
NICK DWYER
Live is not Ableton Live, it’s Ableton
====================
The internet would be a great place to learn, but it’s not a digital place. And if you have a computer, you can’t even tell the difference between the different versions of a song. 
Even before we had the internet, we were used to downloading songs. Now we are used to downloading tracks, and sometimes it’s a remix or a new version. We don’t have to look through all of this stuff. We can just go download something. 
We do that. We can download a track that we just like, and if it’s different and not something we want to hear, we can just jump, go do an album, just like we go download something. It’s like the next album will come out, and you just can’t tell the difference between the versions. 
I think that’s the way it has to be, too. You don’t need to see the difference between different versions. If you have a computer, there’s no difference, because you can just go download it, and if you want to know something about it, it’s the same. But if you have a computer, you can’t even tell the difference between the versions. If you have a computer, there’s no difference. Do you have to have two computers? 
Audience member
I don’t. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao 
It works out that way, does it? It may not work out for everyone. But for me, it works out that way. 
I think people have to realize that they’re getting a lot of information from different sources, and that’s great. I can tell you I’m not going to be doing my own analysis and stuff. I’m just going to be following the flow, and if I feel something that I’ll be able to relate to, then I’ll throw it out there. But I’m just going to be following the flow, and if that’s not what I need to hear, then I don’t want to listen to the other stuff. 
Usually, when you’re listening to something, it’s interesting to know what it’s about, because you can read the lyrics, but at the same time, you don’t really know what it is about it, so you’re just following the flow, and then, if it’s good, you’ll keep listening to it. I think that can be a good part of it. 
Audience member
I think they mentioned that you listen to things in reverse. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
No, I don’t. 
Audience member
I think it’s a good thing you listen to what you listen to, because when you listen to something, you get to know the whole music. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
That’s why I bring up the reverse brain, because let’s say you have a lot of music, and you have a lot of people listening, and some of them love it, and some of them hate it. 
I have a friend, he listens to music at home, and sometime at night, he will just turn on the radio and listen to something, and then he will be like, “I just want to listen to something.” We’ll listen to the same thing, but we won’t listen to any of the other stuff. Then, when we get to the end, we have to decide, “You know what? I’ve listened to all of these different music, and it’s just a matter of what we feel, but I’ve listened to everything.” 
I think that’s the way it should be. If you have a computer, it’s not like, “Oh, there’s a song that you really like, and there’s a song that you hate, and there’s a song that you like, but the other stuff is just so obvious and obvious. And I think that’s what’s going to be really interesting with this. I think that might be a great way to approach it, and maybe you can bring in other people to listen to stuff, but I don’t know what people’s thoughts are on it. It’s just like you have to read the lyrics. 
Let’s say, I go to the club, and the guy behind the bar is like, “Oh, this guy, this guy.” So, if I hear something, I can just go to the guy behind the bar and listen
====================
So, I did a record with a guy called T.I. and he was from New York. He’s from New York, and he was a big fan of mine. He was very good, he was a big fan of mine, he was a big fan of mine. So, that was me, and as I said, I came in and I worked with the guys, and I was working with just a couple of other guys. But I was working with them, I was working with Suge Knight, and I was working with all those guys, and I was doing a lot of tracks with them. So, there was just a lot of stuff going on, and I was doing lots of tracks with them. That was my first record, and I was working with all of them.
Todd L. Burns 
I think there’s a lot of people in this room who’s really into this type of music, because it’s something you’ve been away from.
Salvador Dalí 
Oh, yeah.
Todd L. Burns 
Well, you left New York early.
Salvador Dalí 
Yeah, it was a big city for me. I lived in Brooklyn.
Todd L. Burns 
So, you wanted to tell us about yourself, and what it was like coming here, and how you ended up working with Suge Knight?
Salvador Dalí 
It was funny, I came here to LA, and I was working on a record with T.I. and just doing tracks with them, and I got one of the records we were working on with them, and I put it out with some of the songs on it, and it was a big hit, and it was really good, and they were doing all of these tracks with me, and they were working with all these people, and they were doing mixed-ups and stuff. So, I started working with them and doing a lot of tracks with them. So it was kind of cool.
Todd L. Burns 
So, you’re working with Suge Knight?
Salvador Dalí 
Yeah, Suge Knight.
Todd L. Burns 
Who’s Suge Knight?
Salvador Dalí 
Suge Knight, he is known as Suge, but he is known as Suge.

AR-15 rifle.
[The gunman] was carrying a Glock 17, an AR-15 was still in the magazine, so he was very good. He had the Glock 17, which was a brand new Glock 17, and he was a good shooter. He snapped the photos because he was an aspiring movie star. We had a good relationship with him, and he used to call me up and say, “Hey, do you have any films of the movie?” “Do you know a movie that I should do for you?” “Have you seen the movie?” He was really successful, and then after that I was like, “Oh, cool.” 
Todd L. Burns
You were really successful? Really?
Robert R. Tucker
Moved by the success. I’m happy. I think if I had kept the film, we probably would have been doing a lot of the same things. But I think for someone who was just starting out, it’s like, “Yeah, whatever.” I never had any problems with the movie business, because I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I didn’t have any issues with the distributor, because they were going to support the movie, and they had money. They had a lot of money, and they were going to support the film. 
Todd L. Burns
I know that you got a lot of issues with the film business, especially with respect to the film business, right?
Robert R. Tucker
I’ve been there, I know that I’ve done the wrong things. I’ve been out of the spotlight, and I’ve had all these incidents. I mean, I’ve been in trouble, and I’ve stopped. I’ve stopped drinking, and I’ve stopped drugs. I’ve stopped doing parties. I’ve been sober for maybe two years, and I’ve been sober. I don’t think I’ve ever been in trouble again. I’ve been sober for maybe two years. I’ve been sober for maybe three years. I just do what I think is right for me, and I think I’ve done my best in a long time. ”I’m sorry, I don’t think I can do that again.”
Todd L. Burns
You have a lot of issues with the movie business, right?
Robert R. Tucker
I mean, there was a movie in LA called A Daily Caesarean. It was about a woman who was pregnant with a child, and she had a miscarriage, and her husband had a home birth, and she said, “Oh, God, I just got to do this movie.” It was a very tragic movie, and I think that was a highlight of my life. I didn’t want to be in a movie that was going to be a big box office hit, and I think that was a big movie, and I’m like, “My God, I’ve done my best in a long time, and I’m going to do it for them.” 
Todd L. Burns
I think that’s a good thing.
Robert R. Tucker
Yeah. 
Todd L. Burns
You have a lot of issues with the movie business, and it’s a very young industry, is it not?
Robert R. Tucker
I know it is, it’s a big industry, and it’s a very, very small industry. I think it’s just got to get away from the movies. I think it’s got to get away from the music sales, because that’s what we’re up against, and we’re out here for our kids. I don’t think we’re going to be getting away from it. 
Todd L. Burns
You mention some of the things you’ve experienced with the film business, and I appreciate that. I mean, the film business is not something that you really see, right?
Robert R. Tucker
I don’t see it, not at all. I see movies every day, and I see movies once in a while. But I’m not going to be that one. I don’t think I’m that one, but I’m not. 
Todd L. Burns
Are you kidding, right?

No, I ain’t.

But you’ve had some really tough experiences with the film industry, right?

Losing weight is not about how much you eat or exercise or what your friends think, it's about how much you see. It’s about how much you feel and how you see yourself in the mirror. It’s about what you see when you go in the mirror.
If you want to be a better person for yourself and for others, then you need to see yourself in the mirror every day. You need to see your body in a different light every day, which means that you see yourself in a different light every day and that counts for a lot.
Losing weight is not about how much you eat or exercise or what your friends think, it’s about how much you see in the mirror. It’s about how you see yourself in the mirror every day and that counts.

I just wanted to know if you ever consider yourself obese because that’s such a big part of what you do.
Losing Weight is About... [applause]
Losing Weight is About Knowing You Are Not Alone In The Universe [laughter]
Losing Weight is About Being Gentle in Your Feedback [applause]
All the people who talk about, like, “I need to lose weight,” they talk about, “I need to lose weight.” They just don’t have any weight. They just know. Some people are like, “I need to lose weight,” others people are like, “I need to lose weight.” Sometimes people just say, “I need to lose weight.” I just never know.
I’m not going to be a big figure for myself, but I’m not going to be a big figure for everyone. I’m not going to be a big figure for a lot of people. I’m not going to be a big figure for everybody. I don’t know exactly how to do it. I just start with what I know I know.
Torsten Schmidt 
It has to do with what you see in the mirror?

It’s not about how much you eat or exercise or what your friends think, it’s about how you see yourself in the mirror every day.

Losing Weight is About Changing
Torsten Schmidt 
People say that weight loss is about losing weight, but weight is actually very a very important part of what we do to get in shape. We’re not going to lose weight in a day, we’re actually going to lose weight over months. It’s about what we see in the mirror every day and changing your shape is really important.
Losing Weight is About Changing Your Body
Torsten Schmidt 
You see, when you’re a teenager, you’re like, “Whoa, ooh, gee, I can’t lose weight, I’m not going to lose weight,” you know?

Torsten Schmidt 
I mean, it’s more than a diet or a workout, it’s about being a better person.

It’s really important, it’s about changing your body. It’s not about how much you eat or exercise or what your friends think, it’s changing your body, changing your body.

People say that weight loss is a diet, that weight loss is a diet, that weight loss is a diet. Maybe it’s the opposite, but people have different ideas of what weight loss is, and it’s different for everyone.
Losing Weight is About Changing Your Body
Torsten Schmidt 
I think that’s true. You see, it’s really important to understand that you’re not weight-losing just because you’re not a big figure like that. It’s also about changing your body. It’s not about
====================
From there…
Brian Eno
I didn’t know about this, but I was working in a hotel in Berlin, and a hotel in Berlin would always have a very good record shop. Just in the first year, the noise that comes out in a coffee shop, it’s not good. And so the noise that comes out in a hotel is very small. The noise that comes out there is really terrible. And so I definitely never thought of it as a problem. And so I think the [Ramaphone] thing is a problem, but I think it’s good what you’re doing there.
I’m going to play one of my big records at the moment, which is a record by the Disco 100, and it’s a new kind of house record, which is very rare. It’s a very expensive record by the Disco 100. But it’s a house record, but it’s very rare.
(music: Disco 100 – “You’re Not A Disco”)
Brian Eno
I think I was listening to the Disco 100 when I was in Berlin. But I think it’s a very good record. And the best thing about it is that it’s based on the idea of a disco, and so it’s very interesting.
(music: Disco 100 – “You’re Not A Disco” / applause)
Brian Eno
I mean, I’m a disco lover, because of my wife, she was into disco, but she was into something else, and she was into rock and roll, and she was into dance music, and so when I was living in Berlin, it was very easy to go to the disco, because the first time I went to the disco was in the end of ’80s, ’80s, so that was very different to me. I was more of an artist-type person, and so the first time I went to the disco was in the end of ’80s, ’80s, so I think that was very different.
But the fact that I was a world-class DJ, and so it’s interesting to play that record, because it’s very often the case that I play the record that I liked the most at the time, and then the second record that I play, I try to play the record that I like the most, and then the third record that I play, and so on. And now, I have a lot of records that I don’t like, and I think I have a lot of records that I don’t like, because when I go to the disco I try to play those records that I like the most. So the music I play is always very basic, and so I try to play the records that I like the most, because that’s my approach.
Brian Eno
It’s interesting, because sometimes people know that you’re going to have a lot of records, but they don’t know if they’re going to be in the club. Sometimes you can’t know if you have enough butts. 
Brian Eno
Of course, you don’t want to be too short, you know? It’s very important that you don’t go through your whole life and then decide, “I wish I had more butts,” because then you’re going to have a lot of records. But sometimes, I think it’s really good to have a record that is very, very new to you, and new to you. Because you know what, sometimes you can change your approach. Because if you have too many records, you will not be able to focus on the things that you want to try. That’s always the thing you have to be really careful about, all the time. And so when you have too many records, you can’t be so good that people don’t know what to expect. But if you have too many records, there’s a good chance that it will be very difficult to find them, because the people who want the best records, they’ll know what they want, they’ll know what they like, and so on. But if you do have too many records, you have a limited amount of time to look in every record shop and so on. So it’s very important to have a record that you enjoy, and so you can concentrate on the things that you need to do. 
Brian Eno
I think that’s true, the same way that you had to think about making music before you were going to record, it was listening to records, and so on. And so it was very important to have a good record, and
====================
But it was the greatest thing.
Gerd Janson
The greatest thing was that. You couldn’t have made a better record. I think I’ve seen some people say, “Oh, it’s really hard to make a record.” I said, “It’s not really hard to make a record,” because I had to get out of there and go to work in a record shop. I said, “I can’t be in this job if I can’t make a record.”
Nick Dwyer
You were also involved in a lot of different records, so you had a lot of influences. What was it about that?
Gerd Janson
Well, let’s say you’re in a record shop and you see a record like “Dissection” and you’re like, “Oh, that’s a really good record.” You buy it and it’s really good. You don’t know what kind of influence it’s going to be, but you know you like it. But that is not the same as making a record that you know you like. You don’t know if that record will reach your ears. You don’t know if it’s going to be the kind of record that you want to hear. We were quite lucky in that way because there was so much talent out there. One of the things I have really fondly about it, that’s perhaps one of the things I will always do, but it was the great thing that I was involved in the record business.
Nick Dwyer
How did you know when you were making a record, you can’t just make a record just by listening to records?
Gerd Janson
I think that’s a very good question, and I think it’s a good one. I just don’t know how to answer it. When you listen to a record, you can’t just listen to a record, you have to listen to other records. You have to listen to what’s happened in the last 10 years, and maybe listen to something else. Because some people are more connected to a particular rhythm and a particular note or a particular band, they might get that same feeling. Some people might not get that same feeling. I think if you listen to a record, you have to listen to what’s happened in the last 10 years. It’s a good question, to be honest with you. I think that’s very good.
Nick Dwyer
I mean, you couldn’t afford to be a DJ, so take a lot of supplies, right?
Gerd Janson
No, I’m not going to say that. I’m not going to get a job DJing. I’m not going to get a job DJing. I’m not going to get a job DJing. But I mean, I have to admit, I’ve been a DJ for a long time. It was very difficult at first. I was really into it, but then I realized that I was more or less limited to what I could do. I was not able to get a good record, I was not able to get a good gig, I was not able to get a good label, I was not able to get a good record. It’s like that. I think one of the things that I think that helped me was that I had a really good soundsystem. I had great speakers. I had a lot of speakers, but I don’t know what they do, but they were good soundsystems. They were really good soundsystems. I just don’t know what else to say about that.
Nick Dwyer
I mean, you’re from Germany, right?
Gerd Janson
Yeah, I guess. I can’t speak for my country. I don’t know if they’ll come to my country, but it’s not a country that I would want to do anything in. I’m not going to do anything in Sweden, either.
Nick Dwyer
You said you talk to a lot of people, but what are they talking about?
Gerd Janson
They’re talking about dubstep, but they’re talking about being involved in the scene, but they’re not discussing dubstep. They’re talking about dubstep but they’re not talking about it. I think they’re talking about it, but they’re not talking about it. [laughs]
Nick Dwyer
It’s interesting because at the time, people were saying, “Hey, the

This is the MC-5 bit and it was a bass drum.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Torsten Schmidt
Yeah.
Todd L. Burns
It’s a take off from the MC-4.
Torsten Schmidt
They’re based on the MC-4, right?
Todd L. Burns
Yeah.
Todd L. Burns
They’re based on the MC-4.
Torsten Schmidt
Probably.
Todd L. Burns
Yeah.
Torsten Schmidt
That’s another one I wanted to ask you about because it’s a little different. How do you feel about it, because there’s this tonal thing that you get with the MC-5?
Todd L. Burns
It’s a different thing. It’s a different thing. It’s a different thing altogether. It’s a different thing. It’s not like the MC-5, it’s a different thing from the MC-4. It’s different from the MC-3, it’s different from the MC-4, it’s different from the MC-5, it’s different from the MC-3, it’s different from the MC-3, it’s different from the MC-3. It’s different from the MC-4. It’s different from the MC-5. It’s completely different from the MC-3. It’s totally different. It’s just a unique thing. It’s really a bit different, it’s just a completely different thing. It has that whole tonal thing, it has a different tempo than the MC-3. It has an urgency to it, it’s a different thing altogether, it’s quite different. It’s a different thing from the MC-4 to the MC-3. It’s a different thing from the MC-4 to the MC-3. It’s different from the MC-4 to the MC-3. It’s different from the MC-3 to the MC-3. It’s different from the MC-3 to the MC-4. It’s completely different, it’s a totally different thing.
Todd L. Burns
It did in the beginning. When you make a record like this, do you want to have it sounding as different from the other ones you made?
Todd L. Burns
Yeah, it’s a different thing. It’s a different thing altogether, it’s a totally different thing. It’s a totally different thing. I mean, it’s like, for us, it’s just a record. I mean, you want to record something that you love and you want to make the best records you can. It’s a very emotional thing, it’s very powerful. It’s a very powerful thing. I mean, you know, it’s a very high quality, it’s a very expensive record. It’s a very expensive record, it’s a special record, it’s special. It’s one of the best records that we made. It’s really special.
Todd L. Burns
Yeah.
Todd L. Burns
It’s really special. It’s a record that’s very good, it’s a record that’s big, it’s a record that’s a big record. It’s a record that’s a big record, it’s a record that’s big, it’s a record that’s big. It’s a record that’s big. It’s the first record that I’ve ever made that’s been made on an MC-4, it’s the first MC-4 record that was made on an MC-5. It’s a special record. I mean, it’s a very special record. It’s a very special record. It’s a very special record. It’s a very special thing.

We’re talking about this kind of dubstep era, and we’re talking about a lot of different things, from the drum & bass of the ’80s, to the original Detroit techno records, to Detroit techno of the ’80s, to Detroit techno of today’s. The electro scene that we’re talking about is really the scene that we are talking about. Many Detroit techno DJs are going to be bringing their own house sounds at this point, but it’s more like Detroit techno, but we’re talking about Detroit techno here. Of course the Detroit techno is very different to what is going on in New York, I’m talking about Detroit techno at this time, because I think the Detroit techno is still very, very different from New York, but I think it’s getting better, it’s getting more recognizable, and it’s getting more popular. 
It’s getting more popular because Detroit is not the only one, but Detroit is the only one that’s doing it. So it’s the kind of Detroit techno that we’re talking about. 
Gerd Janson
So you’re talking about Detroit techno, basically, and what you’re talking about is Detroit techno. 
Frankie Knuckles
Yeah, definitely. We’re talking about Detroit techno, but it’s Detroit techno, it’s Detroit techno, it’s Detroit techno, that’s all I’m talking about. 
(music: Detroit techno – “The No 1 Hit”) 
(music: Detroit techno – “The No 1 Hit”)
____________________ 
So Detroit techno is very different from New York or Chicago or Boston or whatever. 
Frankie Knuckles
Yeah, definitely. We’re talking about Detroit techno, Detroit techno is still very unique. It’s very, very, very, special. I’m going to say the Detroit techno scene is very special, because it’s got its own identity, it has its own style of music, it has its own vibe, it has its own music, it has its own flavor, and that’s still Detroit techno.

A lot of Detroit techno DJs are coming back into Detroit, and they’re doing it the right way, but this is their thing, because they want to be Detroit techno, they want to be Detroit techno, but they want to be Detroit techno. It’s great to see, but what is it that makes Detroit techno special? It’s not going to be the same as what New York or Chicago or Boston do, because Detroit techno is so unique. 
[laughter] 
Nick Dwyer
So there you are. 
Frankie Knuckles
Yeah, yeah. 
Nick Dwyer
So when you were talking to some of the Detroit techno DJs, they were talking to you, they were talking to people at the time, they were discussing Detroit techno, but what was it about that, that you thought to bring that kind of flavor to Detroit techno, and what kind of video did they use to show you?

When I was younger I just watched movies about jazz and I was just fascinated by jazz artists. I started to listen to jazz when I was in high school, and I was just fascinated by jazz artists. I just heard it in restaurants. I was looking for that music, that was what I wanted to hear. It wasn’t anyone’s work, it was just a lot of people. It seemed just like everyone was doing what they were doing. I didn’t feel that it was like a new thing. I just expected that it would be too old and too old. I didn’t even like it, as a matter of fact I don’t like it, but I just thought it was just not new.
I started listening to it when I was in high school, and I was just fascinated by jazz artists. I started to listen to jazz when I was in high school, and I was just fascinated by jazz artists.

I started to listen to jazz artists as a teenager, and I was just fascinated by jazz artists.
I’m just really, really proud of it. I’m really proud of it, because it’s the first time I’ve ever heard a record that hasn’t been bought at a record store before, and I don’t know if you guys have heard it before, but I was in high school in the same neighborhood as this guy called Warren G, who spent his entire life in Philadelphia. He worked at McDonald’s, he worked at a restaurant. He worked at Burger King, he worked at the big chain of McDonald’s. I was in my high school, and I just saw him every once in a while, and I was like, “Wow, this dude’s got this incredible talent, and he’s making records that’s amazing.” The kid had this gift in his music, and I was just like, “You got to hear it.” And I saw him play a lot of records, and I wasn’t here when he was in high school, but I was in high school. I was in high school, and I watched him play, and that was my first time hearing a record in a record store. I was in the same neighborhood, and I was just mesmerized. I was just like, “This guy’s got this talent, and he’s making records that’s amazing.” He was just really, really talented. I was just mesmerized by it.
Torsten Schmidt
Did you ever see him in a band?
Pat Metheny
I did see him play at the local country club, but I didn’t see him in a band. I saw him play, and we just hung out. He was just a kid, he was just really good at everything, and I liked him also, but I didn’t know how to deal with him. I wanted to get him out of my life, and I just couldn’t deal with him. I tried to get him out of my life, and I didn’t know how to deal with him. So I didn’t even see him in a band for a long time. And then it was just a matter of, “What can you do, what can you do?” And then I was really fortunate to learn how to deal with people who needed help, and I would just help them out.
Torsten Schmidt
You have a real passion for your music, and a passion for your music and your talent, for your music, when you’re young.

I just love the music, and I love the music of other artists, and I love the music of other musicians, and I love the music of other musicians, and I love music, and I love the music of other musicians, and I love music, and I love my music, and I love my family, and I love my friends, I love my little sister, I love my friends, and I love my family, and I love my friends, and I love my friends, and I love music, and I love all my friends, and I love music, and I love everything, and I love the environment, and I love my friends, and I love the whole world, and I love my friends.

“I”m not sure how to answer this question if you are a male, because I saw the movie, The Birth of a Nation. It was like a movie about the Congo that was released in 1975. It was a very popular movie in the Congo. The film was shown in the Congo, the United Nations, and it was showing in the United States.

I’m a big fan of this song. I think this was released as a single, and it’s called “So I Get Home.” I think it was released as a single, and it’s called “So I Get Home.” 
(music: The Replacements – “So I Get Home” / applause) 
The Replacements
I think this is one of the greatest songs I’ve ever heard, and I think it’s one of the best songs ever. 
(music: The Replacements – “Get Your
Mouth Out” / applause)
The Replacements
Yeah, I think that’s a great song, you know? I think that’s what they’re all about, you know? I think that’s the thing, you know? It’s one of the best songs ever, and it’s like, “Oh, wow, I’ve just seen a lot of music, I’ve just seen a lot of music.” I mean, this is older music now, but I think this was the year of “Don’t Stop Believing,” and “That Was A Long Time Ago.” I mean, it is, in a way, “You’ve Got It,” “Keep It Moving,” “I Want You Back.” And I think that was very important in those times, and I think this is one of the best songs ever. If you believe in the power of music, if you believe in your music, if you believe in your culture and you don’t have to worry about what the people in that room think, you can cut it down to a really simple thing: “I want you back,” and that’s what it means to me, to be in the room with you and know that you’re all about being strong and not being afraid to be different, and that’s what keeps me coming back to music as a whole. 
(music: The Replacements – “Talkin’ Loud” / applause)

Thank you.

The Replacements
Yeah, so yeah. 
(music: The Replacements – “The Love Below
Time” / applause) 
The Replacements
I think this is the only one that we’ve ever put out on major label records. That song was a big hit for us, and I think it’s always been a big hit for us. A lot of people went to Japan, and they had it on the radio, and they were really looking forward to hearing that song, and they were really kind of into it, and that’s what we want to have happen for ourselves, is that, when we release on major labels, the songs always get big, and that’s what we want to do with all of our music, is to have a big song that we want to put out on major labels, and that song will always be truly special. 
(music: The Replacements – “The Love Below
Time” / applause) 
The Replacements
Yeah, yeah. 
(music: The Replacements – “The Love Below
Time” / applause) 
The Replacements
This is “The Love Below Time”. I don’t know if you guys know, but the Replacements are kind of an iconic band, and no one wants to be associated with this band, or anybody, ever. They ain’t going to be around forever, they ain’t going to be around forever, and they ain’t going to be around forever, and that’s no one’s business. They ain’t going to be around forever. So, in my opinion, the Replacements is somebody that when you hear their record, it’s always like, “Oh shit, they got a hit song.” And
====================
Obviously we have a lot of people here, so I just want to just talk a little bit about us and talk about our music. I want to say thank you, thank you, to every one of you and everybody that has supported this project.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I think it’s fitting, I think it’s fitting that we start the history of the independent label, the Toronto label, to start this one, because we’re in the same place, we’re in the same moment. We’re a beautiful city, we’re a place that we can be proud of.
Toby Laing
Yeah, and what I love about Toronto is that people come to the music, to the music scene, they come to me, they come to the label, they see that I’m a producer, they see that I’m a musician, they see that I’m a producer, they see that I’m a musician. 
They love that I can be in the studio. I can’t be in the studio, I’m a musician. For me, it’s like, “I’m not a musician, I’m not a musician, what do I do?” I’m a producer, music is a creative experience. It’s a creative experience, I can’t make music for myself, it’s not my job to make music for myself. I want to make music for my friends, my friends, and my family, and I want to have fun, and that’s what I want to do.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Let’s give a little bit of a tour of what that means, because what it means is that we’re in the early days of independent labels, they would only be on the radio and they would only be on the radio for a short time, and then they would go, “Oh, yeah, I can do this.” Now, I’m in the UK, I have my own label, I can put out a record and release it as my own label. It’s getting to the point where it’s time to get a real label. Let’s just say we don’t have a record coming out. Let’s just say there’s no music coming out. Let’s say there’s no release dates coming out, or whatever. So, what do we do? What do we do?
Toby Laing
The first thing we do is we play our record on a radio station on the radio in Toronto, Toronto, and then we play on a radio station in the UK, and we play on a radio station in the USA, and then we play on a radio station in Europe. And then we play on a radio station in Japan, and it’s like, “This is cool.” Now, with that being said, I can’t do this for myself. I want to be a musician, I want to be a producer, I want to have a good time, I want to have a good time with my friends, and I want to have fun. It’s like anything else. It’s like, if you do it for yourself, you’ll be happy. You’ll be happy, and you’ll feel good. Because you’ll feel good. If you do it for the friends, then you’ll feel good, and everything will be good. If you do it for the fans, then you can feel good, and when you make a record you can feel good, and when you release it you can feel good. 
If you’re not happy, then you know how to do it, it’s not a good record. If you’re not happy, then you’ve got to do it, it’s not a good record. It’s not that you’re going to fail, it’s you’re going to fail. If you’re not happy, then you know what you’re doing, you got a choice. You can either be happy, or you can be sad. It’s not either, it’s either you’re happy, or you’ve got to do it. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
What do you feel is the key to success in independent labels? 
Toby Laing
I think the key is that you’ve got to be a good listener, you’ve got to be a good listener, you’ve got to be a good listener, you’ve got to be a good

The student body president of a Florida college said the school's administration is using the state's educational opening hours to promote the use of video game playing in classrooms. He said a teacher at a Florida high school was suspended for smoking in class.
In an interview with the Miami Herald, Brian Johnson, president of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), said the school administration was adding a video game element to its curriculum.
"That was not my idea, it was a teacher at the high school," Johnson said, adding that the video game was a "disrespectful" distraction. "I still think it's disrespectful that the teacher is not allowed to smoke in class, but that's not the way it is in the classroom. That's a distraction, it's not a real distraction. It's like putting a video game on your laptop."
The video game, which won a rave at this year's Game Developers Conference, is a game called Super Mario World. It is a video game where you control a character, Mario, a boy, and controls a game character. In the 1980s, video games were not seen as being in danger, but now, with the popularity of video games, the importance of games and the type of video games that are being played, people are starting to lose their jobs.
The student body president of the RPI said the school administration is using the state's educational opening hours to promote the use of video game playing in classrooms.
He said teacher Duncan Palmer was suspended for smoking in class. He said he was caught by the school administration using the video game to distract students.
"He was playing Super Mario World, he was playing the game and he was having a bad time with it. That was the last time we ever saw him in the classroom," Johnson said. "He was playing the game and it was like a distraction. You cannot be a teacher or a teacher or an administrator or a student body president and be buying a game. That was the last time we ever saw him in the classroom. He was playing the game. He was having a bad time with it and then the video game was on.
"It's an interesting thing because it’s a game that people can’t understand, it’s not a game that people can understand. It’s not a game for adults, it's for kids. It’s a game for kids that doesn’t have enough depth, it’s a game for kids that you can only play for kids. It’s a game that’s not played for adults. It’s not for adults, it’s just for kids that can’t understand what’s going on. It’s been a distraction for the whole school. It’s been a distraction for all of us. It’s a distraction for all of us, but that’s the problem. It’s just not a distraction, it’s a distraction. If you’re going to have a video game, just be a good sportsman, you know what I mean? If you want to be able to play Super Mario World, let’s have video games. I don’t care if you want to have Super Mario World. If you want to be able to play Super Mario World, we can have Super Mario World. If you want to be able to play Super Mario World, you just have to be a good sportsman. It’s just about knowing what you want to do. It’s not about you having a video game, it’s about you knowing what you want to do and what you want to get out of life.
"If I can’t get out of my carbon monoxide inhaler, I’m not going to be a good sportsman, I’m not going to be a good student body president, I’m not going to be a good sportsman, I’m not going to be a good student body president, I’m not going to be a good student body president, I’m not going to be a good student body president, I’m going to be a bad sportsman. I’m not going to be a good student body president, I’m not going to be a good student body president, I’m not going to be a good student body president, I’m going to be a bad student body president. I’m not going to be a good student body president, I’m not going to be a good student body president. I’m going to be a bad student body president, I’m not going to be a good student body president."

But he was in the middle of it, he was on the radio. He was on the radio talking about my mother's death. He was in the middle of it, he was in the home of a friend of mine, he was in the home of a friend of mine, he was living with my mother. He was in the home of a friend of mine, he was living with my mother, he was living with my father, he was living with my brother, he was in the home of my mother. He was in the home of my friend, he was living with me, he was in the living room of my mother, he was living in the living room of my best friend, he was living with my family. I was in a room with my son, I was in the living room of my mother, I was in the living room of my friend.
So, I would go to my mother, I would go to my father, I would go to my brother, I would go to my mother, I would go to my brother, I would go to my friend. My mother was always big in the house, her head was shaking, she was in a bad case of depression, she was in a terrible situation. She was in a very bad place. But she did what she could to make sure that my family was okay. I was always a big fan of her, but I used to always say to my son, “Mom, this is your mother, your mother is going to die tonight.” I was always pushing him into doing the good thing and doing what I could to make sure that my family was OK.
If I made a mistake, if I was wrong, I would just be like, “I don't care, just forgive me, just forgive me,” and it was always that way, “Mom, you will always be right, you always will be right, I don't care.” I always had that hope in the back of my mind. I always had that hope in my heart, because if I did wrong, at least I would be right. If I did right, I would be just like, “Come on, mom, I am a good mom, you are right.” 
But I was never fully ready to make that decision, because I had been through so much, and that is what I was all about. I was always trying to be everything she wanted me to be at all times, and I never really came to her. I was always trying to be everything she wanted me to be at all times. I always wanted her to be happy. She was always looking out for me, and she always wanted me to be happy. I somehow never got it, I never got her to make that decision, she never really came to me. I never really got her to make that decision, she never really looked out for me, she never really talked to me, she never really talked to her mother, she never really talked to her sister, she never really talked to her father, she never really talked to my mother. I never really got her to make that decision, because she never really let me have any degree of control over her, she never really let me out of her house. I never really got her to make that decision, I never got her to look out for me, she never really looked out for me, I never really got her to make that decision, I never got her to make that decision. I never got her to make that decision, she never really let me have any degree of control over her, I never got her to make that decision, I never got her to look out for me, I never got her to go to a good place. I never really got her to make that decision. I never got her to look out for me, I never got her to go to a good place. I never got her to make that decision, she never really let me have any degree of control over her, I never got her to go to a good place, she never really talked to me. I never got her to make that decision, she never really talked to me, I never got her to make that decision, I never got her to make that decision, I never got her to do that. I never got her to do that, she never really let me have any degree of control over her, she never really talked to me. I never got her to make that decision, I never got her to do that, she never really talked to me, she never really let me have any degree of control over her, she never really let me out of her house. I never got her to do that, she never really talked to me, she never really talked to her mother, she never really talked to her father. I never got her to make that decision, she never really looked out for me, she never really said anything to me, she never really talked to

Thanks to the latest technology, a number of materials have been developed that could potentially be used in Biel, including:
“Honey.” I
mean in the mythological world, there is honey and it’s all about the bee. In the mythological world, there is also a lot of stuff, because in ancient times, there is, as we know, there is a lot of honey in Egypt. The honey was also used to make things. In ancient times, there was also a lot of things. We have this thing where the bees were fighting and they could not be scared and they would go for the king and the queen and beat the king and they would get the milk. And in this
production, there is no reason to use a lot of different materials. There are bees. You can find one, there is the king and the queen, there is honey, there is honeycomb, the ones that are common in the production, there is a lot.
So, there is a lot to choose from.

I want to say again, the music, the imagery, the music is there. Music is an important part of the creation of the film. It’s your inspiration, because with the technology today, if you want to make a film that really has that kind of edge, and you can do it in a way that you can have a feeling, the feeling is not just about the visuals or the music, but the feeling of the environment, the feeling is also about the people who are the actors. It’s about the people who are the actors, and you can have a strong feeling about someone’s life by seeing what happens to them. 
And then, of course, the sound, the sound is also a very important part of the filmmaking process. The sound is a very important part. The whole idea of the idea of the idea, of the visual, and everything, is to have the sound. You know, it is very important to have a sound as well. But the sound is also a very important part of the filmmaking process, because a lot of things are done on the sound, and I think one of the best examples of that is when the Queen Mother is in the front of the stage. 
The Queen Mother is a very beautiful woman from a very old Egyptian religion, and she has a very beautiful voice, and her voice is very soft and she does a lot of things that are very important, and, of course, the music is very important as well, but it is also very important to have a strong idea of what your goals are and what your vision is, because that is the foundation of your filmmaking process.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I think that it is important to have a strong idea, and that is also apparent in your work. In a way, you’re in that sort of a place, where you are not in the world with music, you are in this sort of a world where you don’t have a sense of direction, and you don’t know what is going to happen next, and you really don’t know what is going to be. I think it is important to have a strong idea, and that is also evident in your work.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
Well, I always like to be able to say that I am a son of one mother, and this is something that is important, that is why you make films. You can only really work with people who have a strong idea of what they want to do and what they want to get out of it. I think that is very important to have.
Todd L. Burns
First of all, can you give us an idea of what you do?
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
I think I probably do a lot of commercials. I do these big commercials for big, rich movie studios, and I have a lot of money. But I usually don’t do a lot of commercials, because I have the feeling that I am doing something very important. I think, for me, it’s a big challenge, because I want to do something that I want to be able to say that I am a son of one mother, but I don’t want to do something that I don’t want to be able to say that I am a son of one mother. In a sense, that’s why I do commercials. I don’t want to do something that I don’t want to be able to say that I am a son of one mother.
Todd L. Burns
I mean, you’ve been [on] some sort of tour of Asia.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao
We have been international filming. No, we’ve been, I believe, the first Americans to

So you see, that’s a problem for the studio. Some beats that you want to have in a club record, they don’t have to go in there and get mastered. So you have to play it in a club, and if you want it to be louder, you have to do it in a club, and if you want it to be quieter, you have to do it in a club. You can’t just play it to a radio or something like that. And it’s not that simple. So you have to know what you want to do. So I’m always looking for ways to make it loud, and I try to do my best to make that loud.
Nick Dwyer
So in your early music, before you took it to clubs, you used to make music in your bedroom?
Giorgio
Yeah, I recorded in my bedroom. I used to do the club remixes, as well, as long as I had enough money and I had enough recorders. But I was always on the road, and I used to do my music in my room. I used to have a few records in my house, and when I went to the club, I used to do my club remixes. For me, clubs are a very important part of my life. I’m always driven by the club. I’m always looking for ways to make it better, because I love clubs. I love the soundsystems, and I love the living rooms, and I love the party atmosphere. I’m always looking for ways to make it bigger. I try to do my best. I try to do my best to create a sound that will be instrumental in the clubs. But I try to do my best to make it loud, and I try to do my best to make it quieter.
Nick Dwyer
Is it always in your studio? Is it always in your house?
Giorgio
Never. Never. I’m always looking for ways to make it louder. I try to make it loud, I try to make it quiet, and then I try to do my best to bring it into the living room. I try to make it louder. I try to bring it into the living room. I try to bring it into the living room. If I can, I try to be loud, but I don’t want to be too loud. It’s not my best sound. It’s not my best sound. It’s not my best sound. It’s not my best sound. If I can, I try to bring that to the living room.
Nick Dwyer
I guess, you played the club remixes from the ’80s, and you did them in clubs and you used to play them in clubs. How did you start doing that? Did you start as a DJ?
Giorgio
No, I was just a DJ. I was like a party DJ. I used to do the club remixes, and then I used to do the disco remixes. I used to do the club remixes. I used to do the disco remixes. I used to DJ at clubs. I used to be a good DJ. I used to do the clubs. I used to do the disco remixes. I used to do the club remixes.
Nick Dwyer
I mean, you played the club remixes as well.
Giorgio
Yeah, I did the club remixes, but I didn’t do them for me. It was for other DJs. I was a DJ. I was a good DJ, and I used to do the clubs.
Nick Dwyer
Did you bring the club remixes to your house?
Giorgio
No, I didn’t. I didn’t bring them to my house. I didn’t bring them. I didn’t bring them to my house. I didn’t bring them to my house.
Nick Dwyer
I think that’s a similar message to what you have with the club remixes, is that it’s a very exciting thing, but the things that you do, it’s not so fun for you?
Giorgio
No, I don’t like it. I don’t like it. It’s not fun for me. I don’t like it. It’s not fun for me. I don’t like it. It’s more about the dance feeling, and the club feeling. I don’t like it. I don’t like it. I don’t like it. But I try to do my best to do my best to make it loud, and to make it quieter, and to make it deeper. I try to do my best to
