What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno means Mexican music, Mexican music is just a culture. It’s just a lyrical culture. It’s just a culture. And it’s a sophisticated music. And I think it’s the music that’s beautiful because it’s a reflection of Mexico, it’s just a reflection, it’s not a reflection of the world.
Audience member 
I have the same question. Techno is not very suitable for Mexican music because it’s an older generation of people and it’s always been, it’s always been through the eyes of the government. And I’m the first person that’s done that. It’s like if I go to a festival and I say “Don it” or something like this, it’s like, “You don’t have to.” It’s always been a government built into what they do. And I think that’s what we’re talking about, the government built into what they do. And it’s a cultural, it’s a smart way to do it, because it’s very simple. It’s very, very simple, where you have the purpose of music, you have the music of your culture.
And it’s a dance, it’s a dance, it’s a dance, it’s a harmony, it’s a dance, it’s a beautiful way to do it, it’s music that’s very powerful and it’s something that I’m very proud to be, that’s something that I love. And I hope that we will have more information in the future, that this will be part of the conversation, that I’ll be part of it.
Audience member
I have another question. I think it’s kind of interesting if you think about it, because all the legends that you’ve seen in the music industry, which are legends like Ennio Morricone, who is a legend because he was a producer, he was in the top five in the world for the last three decades, and he was very influential in the music industry, and he made millions of dollars. I have a question. How much money can an artist make, what is his salary? And I think, there’s an element of identity in the music, and I think the reason why I have this question is because I see that people are in the studio. I see people making records. I see people making records. I see people putting out records, and I see people doing it for money. I just want to know, how much can an artist make, and what is his salary?
Hector Bellerin
What I don’t know, is if you’re a producer yourself, you don’t know. If you have the chance to be in the top five in the world, you’re going to make a lot of money. You’re going to make a lot of money, but at the same time you have to understand, you have to understand what you do. You have to understand that the people that you work with, and the people that you work with, they can’t know whether they’re happy or if they’re going to work with you. And they’re not going to know whether they’re happy or not. So you have to be realistic, and you have to understand what you do, and it’s not a business, it’s not the world, it’s not the next big thing you want to be in, it’s just a music industry. It’s not very sexy. You have to know what you do. It’s not going to be easy. It’s not going to be easy to work in the right environment. It’s not going to be easy to work with the right people. You have to be realistic. It’s not going to be easy to work with the right people, and then to make the right things when you decide to do it, because you’re not going to be able to ever get to the final destination with everything you’re doing. And the people that you work with, they’ll be there for you, and they’ll be supportive. And if you’re lucky enough to have the right people in the studio,
you’ve got to be prepared because it’s not going to be easy. You have to be realistic, because you’ve got to understand what you do, and you�

Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno means…
TODD L. BURNS
Techno means something like this.
Hector Bellerin
Techno means techno music, and also electronic music, and techno really is a dance music, it’s very experimental, it’s very… techno is very different, because in New York you can just… You don’t have to do it in this all-inclusive, sort of way, but it’s very experimental and very different to what we do, which is really electronic, it’s very different to New York. It’s very… Techno, I think is a very specific type of music, but I think what I love about techno is that it’s very different to what we do, it’s very experimental.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
So you’re not from New York?
Hector Bellerin
No, I’m from New York.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
So you’re from New York?
Hector Bellerin
No, I’m from New York.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
And you’re from New York?
Hector Bellerin 
Yes.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
What was it about New York that you were into?
Hector Bellerin
I think the feeling is very different to the feeling I had in New York, I think the atmosphere is different, it’s very different. I think New York is very different for me, the music scene, the music scene, the music industry. It’s very very different.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
The music industry is very different. There’s no… I mean, I understand that there’s a huge music industry, but there’s no big labels, in terms of distribution or something like that, so it’s very different from what you have in the UK, you have the big labels, which are very, very important, but the music industry in New York is very different.
Hector Bellerin
It’s very important to have big labels, because I think in New York, there’s… I think there’s a big music industry, but there’s no big music industry in New York. I think the music industry in New York is very big because of the big music industry, but the music industry in New York is very different.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
And you’re a very independent person, so you’re not making a lot of money, and you don’t have big commercial artists and big pop artists and stuff like that. That’s very important for you.
Hector Bellerin
I make a lot of money, because I’m very, very, very happy to work for small people, who don’t know much about music. That’s the way I’m able to do it. I don’t have to worry about big artists, I can work with small artists. I’m very happy with my career. I’m happy with my money, I’m happy with my life, and I’m not worried about money. Now, I think I’ve done it, but I think I’m just getting on with it and doing what I do.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
So you’re very happy with your life, and you’re happy with your money. So, you’re very independent in New York, so what kind of artists do you like to work with?
Hector Bellerin
These days, I like artists from Japan, from Europe, from Latin America or something like that. I like artists from Japan, and I like artists from Europe. I like artists from South America, for example, but I like artists from Latin America.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
So, you’re a very independent person, and you’re very passionate about your music.
Hector Bellerin
I’m very passionate about my music.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
So, you’re going to do something with a label, right?
Hector Bellerin
I’m going to do something with a label.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
I think maybe we should just play a track that is from the Techno label, and the others from Techno, but we’ll be playing the track right?
(music: Singer-Songwriter – “Sugar (Hector Bellerin Remix)�
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno, when we started our label, was a very personal label, with no money. It was about the music, and we were not interested in commercialization or making a profit. We were very, very passionate about the music we were making. We were also very successful in doing what we did, and we have great memories from it. It was a very important part of my life. Just like the music business, it's not about putting out records and you can find it on iTunes or the Internet. It’s the same thing: I started out doing music and the music industry also started out as a business. I started out making records, and I sold them and I made money, and I wasn’t interested in being a part of the business. It was a very important part of my life, and I’m very happy with what I do today.
Terry Lewis
I’m sure there are a lot of people who can’t quite comprehend what that means. But I think we’re talking about a very specific part of your life. [laughter] If you’re going to do it [laughter], be careful when you’re doing it. I think in terms of the history of electronic music, and you are talking about a very specific part of your life, I think that’s an important part of what you do. That’s the subject of this interview.
Hector Bellerin
[laughter]
Terry Lewis
It has this [gestures to the corner] part. You’re talking about a very specific part of your life, and I think that’s very important.
Hector Bellerin
I feel like I’m a very good example of what’s good. I made records, and I had good memories and I had good friends. I feel like I’m an example of what’s good. I have great memories, and I can only tell this story that I’m telling you now. It’s not over. I’m going to keep doing this. I’m not going to stop. I’m going to make it, and I’m going to be like a part of it. I’m going to be a part of what I do. I’m going to be a part of the history. I’m going to be a part of the legacy. I’m going to be a part of the history of electronic music.
Terry Lewis
[inaudible question]
Hector Bellerin
That’s my story.
Terry Lewis
I’m sure there’s a lot of people in the room who’s going to make an ableist comment, or a homophobic comment, or whatever. But I think this is important because it’s an example of what’s good, and it’s a case of a first example of what’s good.
Hector Bellerin
That was my first album, and I did it with my friends. We made it for each other. I don’t know what they’re thinking, but it was a very strange thing, because I didn’t know what to do with it. I didn’t know how to do it. I was in a situation where I was like, “I don’t want to do this.” I was in a situation where I was making records, and I was doing it for myself, and I was doing it for my friends, and I was doing it for my money. I’m sure there’s a lot of people in this room who want to do something about someone’s personal history. The track was out, and I’m from Tennessee. I’m from Tennessee.
Terry Lewis
That was a little bit of a key moment.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah.
Terry Lewis
It’s a story that’s very important. That’s my first album.
Hector Bellerin
That’s my first album. Even though my friends thought I was making a bad record, they liked it. They loved the track. They thought it was good, because it was very personal, and they wanted to see me succeed. They’re really good musicians, and I tell you that. I’m very lucky to be here, I’m very lucky to be alive. I’m going to be very happy for everybody who’s listening to this. I’m going to be very sad. I’m going to be very happy for you, because I’m going to be very sad

What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno is a kind of music that was created when I was in my 20s and was in my 20s. It was just a very intense period in my life. I spent a lot of time
storing things, I was always living outside the house. I was always out at night, I was always
putting things in my wardrobe, I was always playing music. I was always taking
part in music, I was always involved in music. It was always a very important thing for me. In my
20s, I was always a part of these communities. It was a very important thing for me.
Gerd Janson
When you were growing up, did you ever think anything would ever happen to you?
Hector Bellerin
No, I was always thinking of myself as a DJ. My parents couldn't afford to buy me a
player, there was no money. I was always in school, I was always in the streets. I was always
taking part in these events, like festivals. I was always in the streets. I was always
doing music. I was always doing interviews, I was always doing things like this. I
was always doing interviews. I was always just constantly playing music, I was always
looking for something to do. I was always passionate and I was always looking for something to do.
I was always looking for something to do, and I always wanted to be in this scene. I always
have. I always have. I always have. I always want to be in this scene, and I always want to
be involved in something like this. When I was in the streets, I was always looking at my
mother as a DJ, and my mother was always always dancing. She was always singing, she was always
making music. She was always dancing. I was always looking for something to do. My
mother was always always dancing, and I was always looking for something to do. I always wanted to
be in this scene, I wanted to be involved in something like this. I always wanted to
be involved in something like this. I always wanted to be involved in something like this.
I was always looking for something to do. I was always looking for something to do. I was always
looking for something to do. I love my mother as a DJ, not just because she does this dance, but
because she always brings up the right things. She always brings up the right things, and she
always brings up the right things. She always has the right attitude, and she always has the
right personality, and she always has the right personality. She always has a good attitude. I feel
good, and she always has a good attitude. I love her. I love my mother. I love her as a DJ.
Gerd Janson
It's been a long time since we last heard from the group…
Hector Bellerin
Ladies and gentlemen, I am talking to a man who has been
in the club and in the clubs since I was 15. Since I was 15, I was on the streets, I was
doing drugs, I was doing everything, and I was always working to get away from my
mother. I always wanted to be in this scene, but I never had the opportunity to be
involved in anything like this. I always wanted to be on the streets, but I never
had the opportunity, I never had the opportunity to be involved with this kind of music.
I just wanted to be in this scene, but I never had the opportunity to be
involved with this kind of music, and I never had the chance to be involved with this kind
of music. I always wanted to be in this scene, but I never had the chance. I always
had this opportunity to be involved in this scene, but I didn't get the chance, I never
had the opportunity. I always had this opportunity, but I never had the opportunity.

What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno is a very beautiful name. Techno is a name that we [use] and we use it in La Strada, but it has something to do with the electronic music. And, like I said, it’s an interesting name, but it’s very simple in music and it’s very simple, but it’s very interesting.
Audience Member 
I would like to know about the existence of Techno in Japanese music, and if you have any information about it.
Hector Bellerin
Techno is very interesting, because it’s an interesting name, but it’s very simple in music as well. If you have information about it, please help me, because I’m really happy.
Audience Member 
I was wondering if you have any information about the name "Techno"?
Hector Bellerin
Techno is a name that was created in Germany in the ‘60s, when the Berlin techno scene was starting to open up. It’s a very interesting name, but it’s not a name that I know of, but it’s one I know of, and that’s Techno, I think.
Audience Member 
I think everyone here is aware of Techno?
Hector Bellerin
Techno was a name of the German electronic music scene in the ‘60s, ‘60s, ‘60s, ‘60s, and it was very popular for that period, and also for other music in Germany, like techno and house and jungle and techno was very popular, and for me, it was very popular, and then techno was very popular in the ‘80s, ‘80s, and it’s now very popular. And I think that was the biggest wave for electronic music in Germany in the ‘80s. You had the trend of the Berlin techno, and it was very popular in the ‘60s, ‘60s, and you had the Berlin techno scene, and it was very popular in the ‘80s. And I think that’s what was happening for electronic music in Germany. It had great success, and it was very popular in the ‘60s, ‘60s, and then techno became very popular. And I think that’s what happened for electronic music in Germany, and I guess the big wave was the Berlin techno, and then the big wave is now the Techno.
Audience Member 
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin 
Thank you.
Audience Member 
Hi, I was wondering if you can give us a hint about Techno, and you’re not from Germany.
Hector Bellerin 
I thought that was very interesting. Techno is a German name, but it’s not a German name. It’s a name that’s been created in Germany, and it’s very popular. And Techno is usually called Techno, or Techno-kun. I think it’s called Techno-kun, or Techno-kun.
Audience Member 
Yeah, well, I was wondering, can you tell us a little bit about the name "Techno"?
Hector Bellerin 
Techno-kun is a German name, but it’s a name that’s created in Germany. Techno-kun is a name that’s created in Germany, and Techno-kun is a name that’s created in Germany.
Audience Member 
Yeah, well, you said earlier that you were from Germany. Can you tell us a little bit about the name Techno-kun?
Hector Bellerin 
Techno-kun is a name created in Germany. It’s a name that’s popular in the ‘60s, ‘60s, ‘60s, ‘60s, and the name Techno-kun is a name that’s popular in the ‘80s. It’s a name that’s popular in the ‘80s, but it’s a name that’s very popular in Germany, and it’s a name that’s popular in Germany, and it’s a name that’s popular in Germany also. And it’s a name that’s very, very popular in Germany.

====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno, it’s a music, it’s how we talk about music and it’s a sound
that you can’t get out of, it’s a sound that you get out of by listening to music and it’s a sound that’s never heard before. It’s a sound that’s never heard before in music, it’s never been heard before and it’s this feel. It’s like you’re like, “OK you can do this,” but it’s never worked anywhere else, it’s never been heard before and it’s this feeling, you know what I mean?”
Audience member
I’m curious, what kind of a connection did you have with Techno, is it like music from Chicago, it’s like the West Coast?
Hector Bellerin
It’s always been Chicago and it’s always been Chicago. We don’t know where it is now, but, yeah, Techno was always Chicago. The West Coast and Chicago is a city that’s known for hip-hop. Techno wasn’t really played out. It was a lot of West Coast stuff, it wasn’t about West Coast, it was just about Chicago and Chicago.
Audience member
And what was the vibe?
Hector Bellerin
The vibe of the band, it was like a whole different vibe. There were Detroit Techno bands and Chicago Techno bands and there was the West Coast, and Techno was always about Detroit, it wasn’t about West Coast, it was about Detroit and Detroit because it’s a city that’s known for Detroit and Detroit was always a big part of what Techno was about, it didn’t talk to you, it was just… it was always about Detroit and Detroit, it’s like, “OK, we’re going to get up on the Drum Machine and do this.”
I think that was the kind of vibe that I’m going to get out of it. I’m really looking forward to playing it.
Audience member
You mentioned that you’re from Chicago and you’re still looking for ways to be out on the road. Do you think that’s part of the appeal of making a record?
Hector Bellerin
One thing that I think was very important to me was that I didn’t know what to expect, I was going to do something that I had never done before in my life. I was always in a hurry, but I was on the road, I was always on the road, I was always on the road. I was never a professional musician, I was just an avid-musician. I had a lot of friends who were professionals, so I was always looking for ways to make my music. I was always trying to make something that I could call myself a professional musician, I was not a professional musician, it was just something that I wanted to do.
I always have a show going on, I’m always making music, but I don’t have to go to a studio, I don’t have to do all of this stuff. I don’t have to worry about that. I’m always making music and I’m always trying to make it better than I could have ever imagined and I’m always trying to learn as much as I could and try to be better than I could be. I’m not going to take it easy, I’m going to be a professional musician and be a professional performer and I’m going to be a professional musician. I don’t have all of that. I’m going to be a professional musician and be a professional performer and I’m going to have to do that.
I’m not going to take it easy, I’m going to be a professional musician and I’m going to have to get better. I’m going to have to do that. I’m going to have to make the records better than I could have ever imagined, that’s when I’m going to get better. I’m going to be better than I could have imagined, that’s when I’m going to make those records better.
If I can do it, it’s going to be better than I could have imagined and that’s when I’m going to get better. I’m going to be better than I could have imagined and that’s when I

When I’m in the studio, I think Techno is the name of the thing. It means sound and it means dubstep. It means there’s some kind of sound in Europe that is like this. That’s Techno. That’s Techno. You can’t have a Techno record without Techno. Techno is a thing. It’s the sound and Techno is the name of it.

====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno is electronic music, I think. At that time, when we started the record company, we were starting off with synths and things, and we got a lot of samples, and I think that we were just really seeing that the music industry, because it’s very important, the industry is very important for the music industry, especially in terms of the production of the music. With this record company, because they had the money to get the records, the money to pay for the equipment, and when you have the money to go and buy the music, you can just point and say, “This is what I want,” and they produce it.
Todd L. Burns
I mean that you signed a contract for a studio, and you signed a contract for a studio.
Hector Bellerin
Yes. We signed a contract for a studio. The recording from the beginning of the record company did not have the money to pay for the equipment, so they had to hire someone to do it. The money they had, they just paid for the equipment.
Todd L. Burns
But you also signed a contract for a studio, what is the contract?
Hector Bellerin
The recording was done in the studio. I think there were about two or three other people who did it, but the recording was done in the studio.
Todd L. Burns
How long was the recording?
Hector Bellerin
I think it was about six months, maybe eight months, and then I just left it.
Todd L. Burns
I think there’s a lot to talk about for the tone of Techno. You’re talking about the church of electronic music, the musicians. I mean, it’s a very different thing to production. You’re talking about a lot of people, from the Chicago hip-hop community to the Chicago jazz community to the Chicago soul community to the Chicago recording community, and you’re in all of them.
Hector Bellerin
Yes.
Todd L. Burns
What does it feel like to be a small producer with a big studio?
Hector Bellerin
It’s very hard to say. We are very small, I believe. I mean, I’m a big producer. I have a big mixing desk, and I can do the mixing, but I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future. I mean, I love mixing, but I have to do it in my own way. I have to be what I need to do, and I have to be creative. I’ve had a lot of people come to me and say, “Hey, what do you want to do?” I’m like, “I just want to do what I do,” and that’s what I want to do. I’m not going to be a big musical producer, I’m not going to have a big recording studio, I’m not going to be a big mixing desk. I’m not going to have a big mixing desk, I’m not going to have a big records.
Todd L. Burns
And what kind of music are you going to be making?
Hector Bellerin
I’m going to be making some hip-hop music, but I’m not going to be making the big stuff. I’m going to be making some hip-hop.
Todd L. Burns
Could you tell us a little bit about what you’re going to be making?
Hector Bellerin
I’m going to be making some hip-hop, but I’m going to be making some music, but I’m going to be making some music.
Todd L. Burns
So you want to be making music that’s big?
Hector Bellerin
Yes.
Todd L. Burns
If you have more of a studio room, you want to put more people in?
Hector Bellerin
Yes.
Todd L. Burns
What do you think about your record company?
Hector Bellerin
I mean, I think they’re a great company, they’re a very good company, but I think they’re just going to go ahead and do what they want to do. They’re going to continue to do what they want to do.
Todd L. Burns
I think that’s okay with you, because I think that’s what was happening with the record companies at the time. Hip-hop, it was a big, big thing, and I think they’re just going to do what they
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno is like the Latin word for music, “we’re going to production this moment,” that’s like the Latin word for a car, the production of a car. Techno is going to happen with the car, with the dj, we’re going to do something with the car. The car is the most important thing, the car is the main thing, because if you can have a car, you can go anywhere and do anything. We’re going to do some records, we’re going to do some techno, but we’re going to make our own music. It’s like this, it’s the same thing, you can do anything you want, we’re going to do the techno, but we’re going to make our own music. It’s like this, it’s a thing like a car, if you want to go to the bathroom, you’re going to do it in a car. If you want to sleep, you’re going to do it in a car, and if you want to make music, you’re going to do it in a car.

Thanks a lot, Hector. Anything else you want to say?

any thoughts on how you approach recording, but also what you
think about the process, because you’ve said before you’re a
techno guy, and you’re very involved in the whole form of making music.
Hector Bellerin
Techno is not a form of making music. It’s just making music. We know we’re going to have this record, it’s a record, if it’s a dance record, it’s a performance record, it’s a record that we’re going to play, it’s a record that we’re going to play to the people. If it’s a record that if a person wants to listen to, we’re going to play it. If it’s a performance record, we’re going to play it to the people. It’s just making records.
Audience Member 
And what is the difference between production and performance?
Hector Bellerin
Production is something that is not defined by a record. It’s like a piece of music, you play it, and you listen to it. It’s like if you want to listen to a song, you can listen to it, if you want to listen to a video, you can listen to it, if you want to listen to a dance record, you can listen to it. It’s like a performance. We want to start producing records for people, we want to start playing records, we want to start production records, we want to start making records. When we started making records, we weren’t going to do the records for the music, we wanted to do the tracks for the music, but we wanted to make music for the people, so we’re going to start making records for the people.
Audience Member 
Hi. Welcome.
Hector Bellerin 
Hi, everyone. I’m so happy. I always say we’re going to do something with the car, we’re going to do something with the car. When we’re making music, we think about the people, we don’t think about the money, we think about the people, we don’t think about the music, we’re not thinking about money. When we’re making music, we’re thinking about the people, we’re not thinking about money, we’re thinking about the music. When we’re making records, we think about the music, we don’t think about money, we don’t think about the music, we’re not thinking about money.
Audience Member 
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin 
Thank you.
Audience Member 
You’re the first one to come to us, and I’ve seen what you’re doing. It’s not as bad as what you’re doing, you’re not as bad as what you’re doing, but you’re doing it in the right place. You’re doing it with the right mentality.
Hector Bellerin 
No, I’m not
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno is a very important part of my life. I’m very appreciative for the fact that so many people see me as the son of the drum machine, because I was born with a drum, which is very important for me, but it’s not very important to me. I know it’s very important for drummers, but I feel very frustrated when people can make fun of a drum machine, because it’s very important to me, but I don’t know what to do.
Gerd Janson
You have a dubstep label, which is very influential on the whole drum & bass sound. What are you using for that?
Hector Bellerin
I use a lot of the same stuff, but I am a dubstep artist, but I am not a producer or anything like that. I want to be more… I want to make music, but I don’t think it’s possible to make music like this in the future. I think it’s very very important to me to make music that is innovative, but if possible, to make music that is quite old-school, and a remix, which is not called “reboot” or “re-edit,” or “re-cut,” because it’s not taking the drum & bass sound seriously, it’s taking the drum & bass sound seriously and it’s not willing to listen to the DJ or to the audience, because it’s not interested in that, which is why I decided to become a producer.
I think the sound I use is very old-school. I think it’s very powerful, and that’s why I try to make it danceable, because it’s not used in dance music, which is very, very important for me.
Gerd Janson
You have a lot of techno in your house right now.
Hector Bellerin
Yes, I do. I have techno, but I don’t have the same music as before. I think I have more techno now. I’m very excited, because I want to do more techno. I want to do more drum & bass, but I don’t have the time. I want to do more drum & bass. I want to do more drum & bass as well. I think there’s a lot of things I want to do. These things are very important to me. 
I’m very interested in getting more electronic music. I want to play more drum & bass, but I don’t have the money for that. I don’t want to be like the DJ, I don’t want to be like the producer, I don’t want to be like the DJ, I want to play more drum & bass, but I don’t have the time. I want to play more techno, but I don’t have the money. I want to do more drum & bass, but I don’t have the time. I want to play more electronic music, but I don’t have the money.
(music: Techno – “Drive” (Hector Bellerin remix) / applause)
Gerd Janson
That was “Drive,” a remix from Hector Bellerin.
Hector Bellerin
“Drive,” I don’t have that, I don’t have that. I think I have “Drive,” I think I have “Drive.” The whole track is “Drive,” which is a techno track, but it’s not called “Drive,” because it’s not used in dance music, because it’s not used in dance music. I think it’s time to get more electronic music, and I think we have some techno producers, but it’s not really the same kind of techno as before. 
I know there are also producers that I like, like Sam Smith, but it’s hard to find them. It’s very hard to find producers, because they’re all very old-school. I know there’s producers that I like, but I know they’re not there yet. I’ve seen that they’re just as old-school as we are. It’s time to get more electronic music, but I don’t think we have it yet. This is very important for me. 
I don’t want to be like the DJ, I want to be the DJ, but I don’t want to be like the producer, I want
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno, to me, is like a little second family, like I said, it’s a family that’s in the same room, and everyone here is the drummer, everyone is the bass player, and everyone’s incredible. And I believe there’s a whole lot of the drummer in this room. And it’s just a very special place. I’m very, very grateful for this place. And I was in a lot of trouble in Spain. I had to go back and get a visa, and the Spanish government had never heard of this school, and I had to go back to Spain, and they took me to a place called ABC, and it’s one of the best places I’ve ever been, and I never got a visa. And I sat and watched with my head in my hands for eight years, and I just couldn’t get a visa. And when I got a visa, I said, “You see? I was in Spain.” And they just didn’t hear of this school, and I had some problems. And when I got a visa, I’m like, “Well, I’m back.” And when the food came through, the manager, the dinner, it was like, “Oh, my God.” And I didn’t know what to do. And I just gave up on everything, because I wanted to go back. And then I got a visa. And then I thought, “Well, what’s the next step here?”
Every time I went to the United States, I had to print a check, and I finally got a visa, and I was able to go back. And I was able to come to Europe, and I just had to make a show. And I was the first DJ to be able to do that, and I was a little kid. And I was the first DJ to be able to do that. And I’m fighting for my life, and I’m still fighting, because I’m losing the battle. And I’m being treated like this is the worst country in the world, and I’m getting treated like this is the best country in the world. I’m fighting to be able to do it, and I’m still fighting. And I’m facing this same situation in Spain, because they did not send me back to Spain. And it’s like, “You understand? I’m not going back to Spain.” If I had a visa, I could have been back in Spain. But they thought I was a drug dealer, and they took me to a place called the Juventino Beach, and I’m like, “Well, that’s not good.” And they gave us the burgers and fries, and everything. And so I went back to my bedroom, and then I got my visa again, and I went back to the United States. And then I was able to come to Europe, and I was able to play in places like Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and I was able to do that. And now, I’m working, and I’m able to put out my own music. And I’m still fighting for my life, with my friend. And now it’s my life, I’m fighting for my life, but I’m not going back to Spain. I’m not going back to Spain. I’m not going back to my hometown. And I’m fighting for my life, but I’m not going to get my visa, and I’m not going back to Spain. And I’m going to be here. And I’m fighting for my life. And I’m still fighting, but I’m not going to be able to go back home, because I’m not going to be able to get my visa.
Amy Winehouse
Okay. So you said you were the first DJ to be able to do that, and you were a young DJ, and you had a lot of problems, and you just had to fight for your life. And you’re still fighting.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah. I just wanted to do it, because I wanted to be able to do it. I wanted to be able to do it. But I can’t do it. I can’t do it. And I’m not going back to Spain, because I’m too old. I have a bad back, and I can’t get in the plane. But I can’t go

Hector Bellerin
Techno?
Todd L. Burns
Techno.
Hector Bellerin

Todd L. Burns
Techno.
Hector Bellerin
Techno.
Todd L. Burns
Techno, that means you have to have a good mix.
Hector Bellerin
Techno, yeah. I mean, Techno is a cultural thing, and we have to do it. I can do music with my voice, I can do music with my voice. At the moment, I’m doing music with my voice because I’m really happy with it.
Todd L. Burns
I know that you’re talking about your
voice, and I know that you’re also talking about your music’s
transformation. You said that you’re talking about the way that the music’s
transformed and made you feel, and now you’re talking about your performance
in concert, which is a whole other discussion.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah. I mean, I’m very happy with it. I have nothing to regret, I have nothing to
apologize, I have nothing to be ashamed of. I can do it. I still have a lot of
problems, but the music is still there. I still love it. I still want to
do it. That’s my music. You can’t talk about the music. This is your music,
you can’t talk about the music. I want to do it. I want to be there. We can’t talk
about the music. You can’t talk about the music. This is your music. You
can’t talk about the music.
Todd L. Burns
Is it something that, in the end, you have to perform? Are you always performing or
is it something you pour into your music?
Hector Bellerin
I have to perform. I have to perform in concert. I have to perform for myself, for
my friends, for my family, for my family’s sake, for my friends. I have to
do it. I have to do it this way. I have to perform. I have to let my heart and my feelings
show. I have to let my friends, my family, my friends, my friends. My friends telling me
that I have to do it this way. I have to do it like this way, and I have to go with it. That
is my music.
Todd L. Burns
What was the moment that you think that you had to do it like this way, that you
got to do it?
Hector Bellerin
I don’t know, it was like that night. I think I had to perform for myself, for my friends. I
go to concerts, and I get to watch my friends perform. I’m very happy with
what I do. I’m very happy with how this music has transformed me. I’m
happy with how my music has transformed my life, and I’m happy with the
way that my music has transformed my life. I don’t want to be ashamed, I just want
to be happy. I want to be happy every day. I can’t be ashamed, I just want to
be happy.
Todd L. Burns
That’s about as close as you’re gonna get to a really direct answer, but what was that moment that you
remember that you had to do this way?
Hector Bellerin
That’s when I felt like I’m going to die. I don’t know
what that is. I think it was the day in Marseille, I think.
Todd L. Burns
Yeah.
Hector Bellerin
That was the day I had to do it. I had to do it like this. I can’t do it like
this, I’m not going to be able to do it. I feel like I am going to die, I
can’t do it, I’m going to die, I’m going to die. It’s not good. I don’t want to
be ashamed, I just want to be happy with my music.
Todd L. Burns 
What was the moment that you had to do it like this?
Hector Bellerin
When I say “I want to be happy,” I mean that’s what I want to do, that’s what I
want to be. I want to be happy, I want to be happy
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno means… I’m a lover of the Techno era. We were born in 1970, so we were picked up by the Techno movement. In those days, Techno was for the working class, and it had all these great records, and it was the era of the bass drum, for example, that I think were really electronic records. It was more like a piano or a guitar. Like, for example, “Techno” was a record from 1974, which was like a Motown record, or a Beatles record. These days, Techno is nowadays more like a disco record, and I think in that period, Techno was a time of love and love. It was a time to be free, and you could have this attitude, “Hey, this is what I want to do.” 
We weren’t influenced by the disco culture, but it had a lot of passionate people who were working on this record, and they were influenced by the Techno era.
Torsten Schmidt
The Techno era, is it called?
Hector Bellerin
Techno was a time of love. It was like a very passionate time, and it was a time of love, that was part of the Techno movement, and it was based on the Techno style, and you could do really strange things with the Techno era. It was a time of love. 
Torsten Schmidt
I wanted to follow up on that a little bit, because we’ve talked so much about the Spanish influence on you, but I wanted to know about the Italian influence.
Hector Bellerin
In those days, there was a lot of Italian music in the music, but they were a very diverse scene. The music was very diverse, from Italian jazz to Italian house and Italian house records. 
Torsten Schmidt
I think that’s a really interesting thing, to me, because you guys are producers, and you guys produce some great records, but you’re also producers with a very distinctive style. Is it like, when you’re in the studio, you’re just looking in the mirror and you’re like, “Yeah, OK.” 
Hector Bellerin
It’s a style, just like the Chicago house is a style, and it’s a style, but you have to have a unique style. You have to have a style that’s special. If you don’t have a style, then you can’t be a producer, you can’t be a songwriter, you can’t be a songwriter. 
Torsten Schmidt
For a lot of people, it’s very important, to be able to gather ideas and inspiration. You can’t just go and go to a record shop, you have to go to a party. 
Hector Bellerin
You have to always be open and take inspiration from other people. If you have a band and an individual, you can just do what they do, and see if you can get something off of them. 
Torsten Schmidt
So you’re just someone who’s...
Hector Bellerin
I’m like that person, you know? I’m not very good at it, but I just try to do what I can do, and try to do it my way. 
Torsten Schmidt
The thing that I think is interesting about your group is that you’ve talked a little bit about being a little disconnected from the rest of the world, because you’re in a very artistic space, right? Which I think can help you get the balance between being creative and being authentic. You know what I mean? 
Hector Bellerin
I think that’s a good idea, because I think that’s what is really important. I think that’s what makes it so special. I think that’s the reason why I’m so happy to be here and the reason why I’m able to do what I do. 
Torsten Schmidt
I think that’s the exact opposite of the thing that you’re talking about. 
Hector Bellerin
It’s not so special, it’s not so... I’m not going to say that’s an excuse, but it’s like I said, I’m a bit disconnected from the rest of the world. And it’s the same reason why I’m so happy to be here. It’s the same reason why I come here, because it’s a very special place. 

====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno is a kind of music when you have a lot of tracks with drums and bass and synthesizers and stuff. You know, it’s always been a musical and musical dance, and there’s a lot of people like me who still like that. I still like techno. It’s a very different kind of music. I like it when it’s really loud, and it’s not just electronic music, it’s also lots of ballroom and it stuff. 
The drum tech is a kind of drum tech that’s used more in ballroom, ‘cause the ballroom is very kind of heavy, is a kind of music that’s very danceable and it’s very, very different. 
I like it when it’s live, when there’s no drums and everything, and it’s slow, and it’s the house, and you can’t hear it, and it’s very, very different. 
I like techno when it’s not techno, like, “Oh, I like this, but here’s another track, and here’s another track.” Because it’s the first time I heard the drum tech. With techno, it’s like, how do you make it danceable? Then, of course, it’s a musical thing, it’s different. 
Audience member 
Hi, I just want to ask, you said that there’s a lot of people in the room. Do you have any DJs in the room?
Hector Bellerin
I have a lot of DJs but I don’t see any. There’s just a few DJs. Sometimes, I have a DJ called Kenny Dope, who is a friend of mine, and he’s from New York, he’s big into the house, and he plays everything, and he’s a good DJ. Usually, I have a DJ called Devyn, from London. I have DJ Todd the Dope, who’s a friend from Ohio. I have the likes of Bobby G, who I think is a good DJ, and I have the likes of Dougie the Dope, who is a good DJ. 
Audience member 
You mentioned that you’re a big fan of the Techno scene. I’ve been listening to the music from ‘80s house and techno. I have a question about the artists that you’ve used on tracks, ’cause it’s quite obvious that you’ve made a lot of tracks and you’re obviously making a lot of different styles. I’m curious about the names of the artists that’ve been on your tracks, because I have two questions. 
(music: André 3000 – “Planet Rock” / applause)
Hector Bellerin
I’m curious about that because I like Fab 5 Freddy, I like Dave Smith, I like Mike Will Made-It, I like Kenny Dope, and I like Bobby G, but what is that? The producer that’s playing this track? Let me see. When I’m making these tracks, I don’t know if I’m just trying to get a good mix or if I’m just trying to get to a good mix. I just have a lot of different producers. I used to get a lot of different producers, because I used to be the DJ for all the DJs at clubs. I mean, I used to be the DJ for the DJ from LA, but I didn’t want to be that DJ. I wanted to play some music. I already have a DJ from Baltimore who plays all the time, and that’s how I always get to the DJ, so I never have to be the DJ, and I can get to the DJ, and I can get to the original DJ, and I’m doing my best to get the DJ to have the right sound to go with my music. 
That’s what I love about it, I’m trying to get the original DJ to have the right sound. I don’t want to be that DJ, I just want to play a good track. I’m always trying to get a good mix. I’m always trying to get the DJ to have the right sound for my music, so I don’t want to be the DJ, I just want to play a good track. 
If I have a good DJ, I try to get the DJ to have the right sound for the track. I totally understand that, �
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno, it means just everything. Techno means that when you have an album, you know you’re going to be able to make the records you want. And it was like, “OK, you want a cool record, I’m going to do it.” And that’s what it was about, it was about making records that you could actually feel inside, and you could feel the music, because of that track, you can feel the way you’re going to behave. Techno, it was about, how is the music that you made? I was born before Techno, after Techno, because Techno was just a religion. It was like, “Oh, I want to be a musician.” And in the late ‘90s, it’s no longer that way, it’s like, “Oh, I want to be a musician.” But as I was growing up, it’s like, “OK, now I can make music.” It’s very important, I wanted to be a musician. It was a religion for me. It was a religion. I was born in Portugal, I was born in Portugal, and I was born in December, and I was born in May, 2004. I was born in October, 2004. I was born in January, 2005.
And I never thought that I was going to be able to do this, I never thought that I was going to be able to make music, but I was born in 2005, and I was born in December, 2004. And I was born in November, 2005. And just because I was born in November, 2005, I was born in November, 2005, because Techno was a religion for me. For me, it was a religion, and it was a religion for my culture, and for my country, it was a religion. And I was always in a totally different direction from everyone else. I was born in November, 2005, I was born in November, 2005. That was my time. And I never thought that I was going to be able to do this. I always had to have that attitude, because I was born in January, 2005, and I was born in November, 2005. So I was born in December, 2004.
Todd L. Burns

Todd L. Burns
OK, so you’ve got the album. It looked like a very interesting album to you. Well, let’s just play a little bit of it, and I’ll give you some context. Tell us a little bit about this record, and we can get a little bit of context.

What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno is a kind of music, that's the word for it. I like it because it means classical music. Techno, it means combining different beats and making them sound like a combination of different instruments. I like it because it means it’s a mixing and processing of different beats, and the idea for it is that you’re mixing three or four different elements. But you can’t do anything with it because you’re mixing it into one. But you can’t do anything with it because it’s a mixing.
[laughter]
Audience member
I guess that’s how it’s supposed to work.
Josef Janson
Techno means mixing and processing, and I can’t mix and process with a drum machine. It’s the mixing and processing of different elements. Techno is a mixing and processing of different sounds. It’s like, “Oh, there’s that one sound, and there’s this one sound.” I like it because it means that’s what I like about music and mixing and processing. It means that’s how I like to mix and process music. I don’t want to be a mixing and processing drummer, I want to be a mixing and processing drummer and be able to mix and process music.
Audience member
I guess, some of the tracks that I heard you just said, “Techno” seemed to be quite experimental and experimental, very experimental.
Josef Janson
Techno means mixing and processing, and I can’t mix and process with a drum machine. I think that’s why it’s called it, “Techno” because it’s a mixing and processing of different sounds. I like the idea of mixing and processing, I like the idea of mixing and processing. It’s a turning and getting rid of elements, and turning and getting rid of elements and combining them in a way. I like mixing and processing because to me, it’s like mixing turntables, it’s like mixing a record, and I like that.
[laughter]
Audience member
Techno is not a style, it’s a way of being. Techno is a way of being, and it’s a way of being. It’s a way of being. It’s a way of seeing, “Wow, that record looks good on the turntable,” and that’s what I love about it.
Josef Janson
Techno, it’s not a style, it’s a way of being. It’s a way of seeing. It’s a way of seeing. Techno is a way of seeing, “Wow, that record looks good on the turntable,” and it’s like, “Wow, this record looks good on the turntable.” Techno is a way of seeing. It’s a way of seeing.
[laughter]
Audience member
Thank you.
Josef Janson
Thank you very much.
Audience member
I think we’re still on track, but I think we’ve just touched on a lot of different topics. Like, like, “How does it work to be on the road?” You know, how do you make it work to make a living out of what you do, and how do you try to be creative while you’re on the road?
Josef Janson
I mean, I’ve got three years of international experience on the road, and I know some people are going to ask, “How do you get away from...?” I know some people are going to ask, “How do you get away from the road work?” I know some people are going to ask, “How do you get away from your family?” I know some people are going to ask, “How do you get away from the road?” I know some people are going to ask, “How do you get away from your friends?” I know some people are going to ask, “How do you get away from your income?” I know some people are going to ask, “How do you get away from your baby car?” It just depends on what you talk about, and that’s what I think about it. I think that’s what makes it work for me, and I think that’s why I’m happy to be here. It’s the question that I want to

I’m a musician, but I don’t know if you’re familiar with Techno. Techno is a dancehall, hip-hop party, and is very popular in New York, and in London, but it’s very sad because every year on New Year’s Eve, people get killed in America due to this kind of techno. Techno is very sad because it’s very very sick. I’m so sad.

It was a sad night, but it’s okay because he’s a DJ, so I can dance. If he wants to dance, he can dance. If he doesn’t want to dance, he can dance. He’s my boyfriend, so I don’t want to spoil him. I just want to say, “How are you?” He’s my boyfriend.
Audience Member
I’m so sorry.
Hector Bellerin
For the people in the room, I’m so happy. For the people who are here, I’m so happy. Thanks for coming.
Audience Member
Hi, I’m from Atlanta and I’m in New York. I’m so sorry for your loss.
Hector Bellerin
It’s okay.
Audience Member
I don’t know how many people here are going to remember, but I’m from Atlanta, and I’m from New York, and I’m just wondering if you can tell us the name of the house music that you used to listen to growing up, growing up as a teenager, like, “How can you like house music?” I’m wondering if you
can tell us where that came from? There’s so many people here that are teenagers, but I’m wondering if you can tell us where house music came from, I guess, and where it’s at?

What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno, what does it mean to you? Techno means a lot to me, because it’s like the beginning of a form of electronic music, and it’s a good thing. Techno is music that’s started in New York, so it’s like the first electronic music. It’s the first electronic music that I know of that has a lot of emotion and they have kind of like a super-strat, and so many people are still in the early stages of their careers. It’s a really good time to be in the scene, and I’m really excited to be in this scene, because I just met a lot of people, and I’m really excited to be there. It’s not like I was in a club in New York, where I’m just playing my music. It’s just like I’m playing my music, and I’m listening to techno. It’s very simple and it’s very deep, and it’s very gentle. It’s very, very simple, and it’s very deep, and I’m excited to be in the scene. It’s cool.

You were talking about growing up playing video games. Did you always want to be a video game player?
Hector Bellerin
No, I’m not a gamer. I’m a musician. I’m a producer, and I like to do more music with my hands now. I don’t like to sit there, and I like to do more recording, because I used to play video games as well, but now I don’t like to play video games anymore. I like to do more music with my hands, because I used to play video games and I’m a gamer. I don’t like to sit there and do digital audio. I want to do more electronic music and more electronic music, because I’m like that person who always is playing video games, and I get excited to be in this scene, because I’m excited to be in this scene, because it’s a very successful scene, and it’s similar to what I like to do. It’s really easy to get into a scene, because it’s always been a young generation, and I’m getting into it as well. It’s very small, and it’s very small, but it’s a very successful scene and it’s on all the radio stations, and it’s on MTV and MTV, and it’s on all the stores, and I’m hearing it all the time. It’s a very successful scene, and I’m very happy to be in this scene.
Torsten Schmidt
At the time you were recording, you’re recording with a lot of different people. You’re recording with a lot of different people on a lot of different labels. How did that feel to you when you were recording with these people?
Hector Bellerin
It was kind of sad when I heard that. It was okay for me, because I was a kid, and I was always on my computer, and I was always playing video games. I always had time to listen to music, and I was always making music, and I was always playing video games. I was always playing video games, and I could always get into a scene, and I was always doing my thing. I was always making music, and I was always playing video games. I was always listening to music, and I was always making music. I always wanted to be in a scene, and I just wanted to be there, and be there.
Torsten Schmidt
It’s interesting, because in its early days, there were a lot of people in the scene who were the most aggressive and the most up-front. What was your role in the scene?
Hector Bellerin
First of all, it was good for me, because everyone who was in a scene had their own label and their own label, and that was good, because the scene was very important, and I was there, and I’m part of the scene, and I’m starting to get into it. But I was only there five years, because I was only there four years. I was only there two years. It was really bad, because I just started to be real aggressive, and I had a lot of people watching, because I was getting into it. It was good for me, because I was able to do them a good party. It was good for my friends, because I was getting into

What does Techno mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Techno means everything. It’s everywhere in sports, music, electronic music. I believe in the music, in music, it’s a beautiful thing, because we’re all human, we can’t live without music. [laughs] I don’t know how to put it, but we’re all human. I don’t know how to put it, but
it’s beautiful when the music opens your eyes, that’s how it’s made, that’s how it’s made. We’re all human.
Torsten Schmidt
But you’re human, right?
Hector Bellerin
I’m human. I’m human. I don’t know, I don’t know. I’m still human. I’m human. I don’t know. I’ll probably be human. I just gotta work on something.
Torsten Schmidt
Did you know when you started it that you were going to be a DJ by day?
Hector Bellerin
No. I was a musician, and I was always a musician. I was a singer, a voice, a songwriter. I was a producer, a songwriter, I was a DJ, I was a radio DJ. I was always a musician. I said, “I don’t want to be a singer and I’m not going to be a DJ,” because I believe in DJing is for people who can’t sing. I’m a singer, a voice, I don’t want to be a DJ. I don’t want to be a producer, I’m not going to be a DJ. I don’t want to do any of that stuff. I’m just a musician.
Torsten Schmidt
You hear some of the people, the people that you’ve worked with on your label, you see “Playground” by DJ Rashad, who is a very iconic DJ. And what is that? I’m going to play a song by DJ Rashad called “Playground”?
[music: DJ Rashad – “Playground” / applause]
Torsten Schmidt
Well, what was that song, “Playground”?
Hector Bellerin
Playground is a song by DJ Rashad, man.
Torsten Schmidt
You’ve worked with him for a long time, I guess, as well, you know, you’re in the garage, you’re in the basement, you’re in the studio, you’re hanging out, you’re hanging out, you’re having fun, you’re excited, you’re happy. Is that something that’s always been part of your life, where you’re working with someone and you’re in their studio, and you’re in the garage, and you’re hanging out and you’re having fun?
