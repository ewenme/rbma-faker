What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It’s not like Berlin, it’s like a basement in the middle of the city. It’s a very dirty, rough city. The people that worked in this factory, they had no health care, they had no food, they had no water, they had no air. I remember going to the airport, I was a little girl. I didn’t know what to do, I was just like, “Damn, fuck it.” I didn’t know what to do. I was too young. I was just like, “Fuck it.” I just did it. I was like an eight-year-old kid and I did it, I was like a little kid, it was my first time. I did it. I did it, I did it, I did it. I had no money. I had no food, I had no water, I had no air, I had no nothing. I just wanted to be like myself. I wanted to be like myself. I didn’t want to be a slave, I wanted to be free. I wanted to be free. It was me, it was my first time. I was just like, “Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.”
Frankie Williams
So this was the first time you had a situation where you said, “I’m a slave.”
Hector Bellerin
Yes.
Frankie Williams
So what was that like and how was it? What did you do?
Hector Bellerin
It was kind of horrible, it was so bad. I was like a slave, I was like a slave. I was like a slave. I had no food, I had no food, I had no water, I had no air, it was so bad. I was so hungry, I wanted to eat. I didn’t want to think, I just wanted to eat, I couldn’t sleep. I wanted to eat. I was so hungry, I was so hungry, I wanted to eat. I was like, “Fuck it, I’m going to kill myself, I’m going to kill myself.” I was so hungry. I was like, “Hell, it’s done, I don’t have to worry about nothing, it’s done.” I was just like, “Damn, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, I’m going to kill myself if I don’t do it.”
I was so hungry, I was like, “Damn, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, damn, fuck it, I just want to kill myself if I don’t do it.” I was so hungry so I just did it, I just did it. I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it. I just did it, I just did it, I just did it.
I just did it, I just did it and it was my first time. I was so hungry that I just did it. I just did it. It was my first time. I just did it, I just did it, I just did it. I just did it. I just did it. I just did it. I just did it.
Frankie Williams
So what made you do it?
Hector Bellerin
I was just like, “Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, I just wanted to kill myself. I wanted to kill myself. I just did it. I just did it. I just did it.
Frankie Williams
So it was not, “I want to die, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.”
So, it was just like, “Fuck it, I just did it, I just did it.”

Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It means trouble, it means trouble, it means trouble. It’s the worst thing that you can do. You are not a human being, you are a dead person. You are an animal. You are dead.
Andreas Hüsker
I don’t think it means anything.
Hector Bellerin
What does it mean? I don’t know. I don’t think it means anything. It’s just that you have to do what you have to do. If you’re not careful, you can’t do anything. What I mean is that there is no future, and you can’t have any children. You’re lucky if you’re not dead. You’re lucky if you’re not in a coma or something.
Andreas Hüsker
I think the culture is very different there.
Hector Bellerin
Yes, yes, yes. It’s very difficult to live like that. It’s very difficult. [laughs] But the culture is different. I think because of the height of the city, there’s a lot of people who have lived there, and they have to do what they have to do. It’s a very poor, miserable city. It’s something else. Just being there, and it’s also very difficult to live like that. I don’t think it’s something to be ashamed about.
Andreas Hüsker
Do you know what I mean? That you’re living like that, but you’re not interested in it, because it seems to you like a beautiful place?
Hector Bellerin
Yes, yes, yes. I think that’s it, it’s a very sad city.
[laughter]
Andreas Hüsker
It’s very difficult to find a job in Germany. I think a lot of people, they’re not interested in getting a job. They’re not interested in getting a job. It’s very important to find a job, because then you can go to a restaurant or something. You can live a decent life. You’re never lonely. You’re never going to have problems. You’re always looking for something, and you’re always looking for something. You’re always looking for something.
Hector Bellerin
I think we have a very nice environment, man. I’m from Milan, and I like it. It’s very good. I like it. I like the city. I love Milan. I just love it. It’s very good. It’s very nice, but it’s not the same as being there, and living in a very bad city.
[laughter]
Andreas Hüsker
Even in Milan, a lot of everything is connected, a lot of people are on the same level. You can’t have a relationship with everybody. I think it’s very important to find a job, and if you don’t have a job, you’re not going to have any money. You’re never going to have any problems.
[laughter]
Andreas Hüsker
I think this is a very important question. I don’t think I’ve heard a question like that.
Hector Bellerin
No, no, no, no.
Andreas Hüsker
No, no.
[laughter]
Andreas Hüsker
[laughter]
Andreas Hüsker
So, if you don’t have a job, then you’re never going to have any money. This is very important.
[laughter]
Andreas Hüsker
It’s a question of what you want to do. If you don’t have a job, your only option is to go to a restaurant, or something. If you have no money, then you have to find something. That’s the only way you can go. If you don’t have money, then you have to find something else. It’s very important to find a job. If you don’t have money, then you have problems, because there’s no jobs. It’s very important to find a job. If you don’t have a job, then you’ll never be free, because there’s no jobs. If you do have a job, then it’s very important to find a job. If you don’t have a job, then

What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It means everything. It’s like getting married in Berlin. It’s like getting married, or getting divorced in Berlin. You get married in Berlin, you’re in the same place, you get divorced in Berlin. It’s like watching a movie, and you’re in the same place, because everybody is the same, and you watch it and it’s very nice. It’s a place with a lot of different things you can do. I don’t know where you go to in your life, but if you’re like me, you can do what I do, and if you’re like me, you can do what I do. It’s a very, very good place, and I’m like my father, I’m like my brother, I’m like my mother, my friends. I love it, I never leave. It’s a place that’s always positive, because if you get married, if you get divorced, if you get whatever. It’s very important. I have a family, and I love my family, and I always will. I never forget it. We’ll come back one day and I’ll see my mother with a child, and they’ll be crying, and I’ll be like, “What’s wrong with you?” And I’ll be like, “Mommy, you don’t have to worry about me, you’re the biggest kid in the world.” And then I’ll see my father, and he’ll be crying, and I’ll be like, “What’s wrong with you?” And then I’ll be like, “Mommy, you son, you don’t have to worry about me.” And then we’ll see, “Son, you don’t have to worry about your mother, you’re the biggest, you’re the best, you’re the best thing in the world.” And then I’m like, “Son, you don’t have to worry about the world, you’re in the best place in the world.” It’s very important to be here, to be able to do what you want to do.
Torsten Schmidt
You mentioned earlier that you’ve been back in your hometown, but what did you do when you came back? You came to the studio, and it was a different scene.
Hector Bellerin
I don’t know. It’s hard to say. I was a very, very poor, I was a very young boy, I was very, very young, I was very naive. My father, he was very, very old. He was very, very old, and his son was very, very young and he was very happy. He’s a very good father, and he taught me to do things. I used to go to school every day, and I was a very, very bad boy, and I used to run around the neighborhood. I used to run around the neighborhood, and I’m like, “What do you want me to do?” I was always running around. I was very bad, and I used to run around, and I was like, “What do you want me to do?”
Torsten Schmidt
How did you deal with the fact that you were working with a white male producer?
Hector Bellerin
I had a very good relationship with my father, and that’s what led me to this, and what I used to do, I used to do this. I used to go to school, and I would do my homework, and then I would go to work, and I would go to school, and then I would go to work. And then I would go to that studio, and then I would go to work. It’s a very good place, and I used to go to work every day.
Torsten Schmidt
What was your first job?
Hector Bellerin
My father was a truck driver, and he would drive around the neighborhood for hours, and he would drive around the neighborhood, and he would go to work. He used to work in this manufacturer, in this factory. His company were about to close, and he could do that truck work, and he could do that, and he would go to work. And he was good. He was good, and he was good.

Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Berlin, in my opinion, is the birthplace of techno in general and the culture of electronic music in particular. It’s a city where techno was born. I listen to techno every day, but it’s the techno that I like. It’s the techno that I like.
Todd L. Burns
At the time, was it? Were you listening to it?
Hector Bellerin
I was listening to it, but I also didn’t know what to do with it. I was into music other than that, like, “Oh, this is good. Let’s do something with it.” I just didn’t know what to do with it. I listened to music, but I wasn’t interested in what was going on at the time. I was into music outside of those things. It was like, “Let’s do something with it.” At the time, it was electronic music, but it was also very important to me, as a kid, that I was listening to all kinds of music. I was listening to everything, but I was made to listen to this one thing, and that’s how I was introduced to techno. I couldn’t find it in Detroit. I couldn’t find techno in Detroit. I could’t find it in Chicago. I’m going to say that’s how I was introduced to it, because I was like, “What’s that?” And I was put into a class of about eight drug dealers, and I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and I was put in a class of about eight dealers, and I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers. It was like, “OK, that’s cool, because there’s a music scene here, and there’s a lot of music there,” and I was like, “Really? I mean, I’ve seen a lot of stuff, but I don’t know if I like it, but I’ve seen this kid’s record, and he’s got a good beat, and he’s got a good song.” I was like, “That’s cool, but I don’t know what kind of music is that.” So, I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and I was put in a class of about eight dealers, and I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers. So, I fell into a class of about eight dealers, and then I was put into a class of about eight dealers. 
Todd L. Burns
So it looks like everyone in this room was brought up in Detroit, but this was only around ten years ago, so, yeah, Detroit was a big part of the Detroit techno scene.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Todd L. Burns
I think of Detroit as a place that you had to be into, because it was an old, industrial city, but now, over the last few years, you have a lot of new people coming in, but it was also a very, very, very, very small city, and Detroit was a very, very, very, very, very, very, very old city, and it was quite scary. It was like a city on fire.
Hector Bellerin
It was fire in the

Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Berlin is a very unique city, not only because of its famous suburbs, but also because of its famous architecture, which most of the places you see nowadays are very modern, very modern, very expensive, but in the late ‘80s, there was a time when you could afford to live in Berlin. I think maybe I only went to see the town every once in a while and it was always very expensive, and I could go to see the famous clubs but then I’d go to the club myself and there’d be a lot of partying and partying and I’d want to go there, but I didn’t.
So we had to go to the city and see the club. There was always a lot of partying, it was very good to have parties, though. One of the main things was there was a big party, there was a big party in the winter. Maybe at the beginning of ‘80s, it was just a club where there was like 1,000 people, and now it’s like 20,000, and at the beginning of ‘80s it was 100,000 people, and now it’s about 1500 people. It’s a very unique city. I think we should have a nice big night. There’s a lot of history in Berlin, and it’s very interesting to have a city, not that famous, but we think it’s beautiful, and it’s very unique. It’s like a part of Germany, I think.
Todd L. Burns
Oh, actually, I just wanted to ask you about your music, what do you listen to in the club?
Hector Bellerin
[laughs]
Todd L. Burns
What do you listen to, as a clubbing DJ?
Hector Bellerin
I like a lot of new music, I like a lot of new bands, I like a lot of new bands. I like electronic music, I like the old school, and I like music that’s very old school, and I like the bad-ass stuff, which is coming from the ‘70s, which is very punk rock, but it’s not dance music. It’s very punk rock, but it’s not dance music.
Todd L. Burns
Maybe don’t play that track.
Hector Bellerin

Todd L. Burns
That was “Home.”

That was “Home,” right?

That was “Home,” right?

Todd L. Burns
That was “Home,” right?
Hector Bellerin

Todd L. Burns
I know you already made a track or two on that one. You mentioned there’s a lot of different sub genres.
Hector Bellerin
There’s a lot of sub genres in Berlin, but there is a lot of sub genres. There’s a lot of different music. There’s a lot of different music, but that’s not the only sub genre. There’s different kinds of sub genres. There’s a kind of party, and then there’s a kind of techno, and then there’s a kind of house, and there’s a lot of different things. But the Berlin house scene is very important to me, because when I was growing up in Berlin, I was very poor, I had no money. I didn’t have a car, I had no money. I used to come home from school with the school bag, the book bag, and then I would go to the club and then I would go to the club. I was never really into the club scene, but then I started going to clubs in my 20s and early 30s. Then I started going to clubs with my friends and we started dancing to the music.
Todd L. Burns
How many people in your family are members of clubs?
Hector Bellerin
My parents are typical, and my father is a DJ. My mother is a DJ, she used to work at a club, and she used to go to clubs. I used to go to clubs and then my sister, who is a DJ, she used to go to clubs.

====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Because it’s a city, it’s a city of many types, and I studied at a university. Berlin is a very important city in Germany. There’s a lot to do, it’s a big city, and I live in the center which is very important for the whole of Germany, for the whole of Europe. The whole of Europe. It’s been very important to the whole of Germany, and also for Italy. Italy has a lot to do with the culture. There’s a lot to do, and it’s very important to live in the center, because that’s the only place you can be. If you want to live in Paris, if you want to live in New York, there’s no way in the world you’ll get in. I’m not going to spend three years in a city that doesn’t understand. It’s very important to live in the center. Berlin is a very important city because it’s the center of all of these countries in Europe, and Europe is the birthplace of all of the different cultures and there’s no other place in the world as important as in Berlin. 
Audience member
You mentioned that you were studying in Germany, and it was a very important place. I think, with all the music you've created and all of the music you’ve created, you’ve met people that you’ve worked with and you’ve met people like—
Hector Bellerin
I’ve met people that have worked with me, and there’s a lot to do. I’ve met people like Prince Paul. I’ve met people like Michael Jackson, I’ve met people that people don’t know about, and they’re great. I met people that I had never met. I met people that I’ve known for 20 years, and I’ve met people that I’ve worked with, and I’ve met people that I’ve worked with over the years. There’s a lot of things to do, and it’s very important to have a good schedule, because sometimes, you’re working at a festival and you’re doing five hours of music, and you’re doing three hours of music, and you’re working for a festival, and you’re working for a record, and you’re working for a label, and it’s just full of people. It’s very important to have a good schedule. 
Audience member
It’s been mentioned that sometimes you’re working on two records in the same day and they’re quite different. Do you have a problem with that?
Hector Bellerin
No, I’m not going to be doing that. I work on two records at the same time. Some people can work on two records at the same time. Sometimes, I can work two records in the same day. Sometimes, I’m working two records, but I’m working on one record. Sometimes I work two records. I’m working on two records at the same time, but I’m working on one record. Sometimes, I’m working two records. I’m working on one record. Sometimes, I’m working two records. I’m working on one record. It’s a very important thing to work on two records at the same time. Sometimes, I work two records, and sometimes I work one record. I try to work on two records at the same time. I try to work on two records at the same time. Sometimes, I’m working on one record, and sometimes I’m working on one record. Sometimes, I’m working on two records at the same time. Sometimes, there’s a record coming out, the first record I’ve done for Casio, a record called “Mandarin”. I have a record coming out with a special artist, a record called “The Price,” that’s going to come out in a few weeks. 
Audience member

What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
I’m an artist and I think that’s what it means to me. It’s like when you go to a club in Berlin, it’s only for artists. You have to go to the club for a club and then you go to the club for your friends. The club over there is for DJs, and they play music, and then you go to the club and you get your friends there, and then you go and you’ll go to the club, and then you go to the club again, and then you go to the club. I’m always going to the club. I think I come to Berlin, because I feel like people who go to Berlin are really interested in music, and they want to learn, and they want to be creative, and that’s what I love about it. I think that’s what it takes to be successful in Berlin.
Todd L. Burns
What would you say is the biggest thing that people should know about, when you’re making music, when you’re in Berlin, is that you don’t get all the negative attention in the United States. There’s no negativity coming from the outside. You get to know the people, and you go to the club for friends, and you’re all about friends and having fun.
Hector Bellerin
I think that’s a really good thing. I think that’s what makes it special. I know people in America, they see what I do, they think, “What’s happening here.” Like in Detroit, you can see how it’s going to be finished, and they’re like, “Well, I never heard that before.” But what I love about it is that I feel like the people that are interested in music are people who are interested in music, and that’s what I love about it. It’s a very human thing. It’s an art thing. It’s something that people are interested in, and it’s something that we can share. I think that’s great. It’s a great thing.
Todd L. Burns
I saw the other day, a friend of ours was really interested in your work, and you said you were confident of your own abilities, and you were confident of your own abilities.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah, I’m confident.
Todd L. Burns
And if that’s all you say, I think that’s the story.
Hector Bellerin
I think that’s the story. I’m going to tell you something about it, so that you can understand about it. First of all, what I’m going to tell you about Berlin is that the people that go to Berlin, it’s the same people that I talk to, the people that work in the clubs in Detroit, they are the people that I use to work in Detroit, and they’re just like, “This is the best thing I’ve ever done.” The people in Berlin, they’re the people that I use to play clubs, and they’re the people that call me to do these things. I think that’s the secret to me, that’s the secret to the success that I’ve had. I’m not going to say it yet, but I’m going to do it. I’m going to do this. I’m going to do it. I’m going to do this. I’m going to do that.
Todd L. Burns
But there were a lot of people that were involved with your music, and I guess that you could say that there’s a lot of people involved with your music.
Hector Bellerin
There’s a lot of people involved in my music. I think that’s how it works. There’s a lot of people involved, but it’s not like there’s a lot, because it’s just like anybody can do it. It’s not like you’re going to make it on your own. I think that’s the secret to it. I think that’s the secret to success, to have success, to be successful, is to be a good friend, and a good music producer. I am a good friend of some people, because I have different friends who’re scientists, and I have people that I love, and I have some people who are artists, and I have some people who are musicians, and I have some people who
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
In 1988 and I started a club called Slow Jazz in the Rheingold. I was a member of the European club, the Society for the Preservation of Human Music. I was also the drummer of the club. I was the pianist, the orchestra player, the singer, the dancers. I was a dancer. I had my own stage in the club, in my home, because I used to play dance and I would dance all over the place. I was very active in the club, in the club and in the clubs. I was a very good dancer, very good. I did dance recitals, in the club, in concerts, where I performed. I wanted to be the best dancer in the world. I was very happy. I wanted to be a star. I wanted to be the best performer in the world. I wanted to be the best performer, but I was not myself. I was afraid, because I was playing in my house, where people would come and say: “Who is this guy?” I was a star, but I was not a star. I was too old, because I had no older brother. I was a dancer. I was very happy. And I was very strong. We were as good as we could be, but I can tell you, I was not myself, and I was not my kind of dance. I was not my kind of person, I was not my kind of son, I was not my kind of husband, I was not my kind of girlfriend, I was not my kind of daughter, I was not my kind of friend. I was not my kind of partner, I was not my kind of friend. I was not my kind of mentor. I was my kind of lover. I wanted to be my kind of lover, my kind of husband, my kind of wife, my kind of daughter. And I wanted to be my kind of companion, but I was not myself. I was not my kind of friend. I was not my kind of partner. I was my kind of lover. I wanted to be the best lover in the world, but I was not myself. I was not my kind of lover, my kind of friend. I was not my kind of wife, my kind of husband, my kind of daughter, my kind of friend.
Audience Member    
Yeah, I mean, you’re a very good dancer, you’re very good.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah.
Audience Member    
First of all, I want to thank you very much, because I am very, very grateful to you, and I want to say something nice to you.
Hector Bellerin
Thank you.
Audience Member    
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah.
Audience Member    
Yeah.
Hector Bellerin
And thank you very much.
Audience Member    
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah.
Audience Member    
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
If I can ask you a question?
Audience Member    
Sure.
Hector Bellerin
I don’t know, I’ll ask you something.
Audience Member    
OK.
Hector Bellerin
The question is, how have you been doing in your life?
Audience Member    
I have been very, very happy.
Hector Bellerin
I live in Berlin, I live in a city called Potsdamer Platz.
Audience Member    
Buch der Schöne, is it a German phrase?
Hector Bellerin
No, it’s Italian.
Audience Member    
Yeah.
Hector Bellerin
It’s true. [laughs]
Audience Member    
I guess.
Hector Bellerin
I think you also live in Germany, right?
Audience Member
Yes.
Hector Bellerin
And you live in Berlin, right?
Audience Member    
Yes.
Hector Bellerin
And I think you have been very, very happy, and you have been very, very, very, very energetic.
Audience Member    
Yes.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah.
Audience Member    
How have you been travelling since August, when did you start a dance club?
Hector Bellerin
I started a dance club in Berlin, in October, ’89. I think September, ’90, maybe?
Audience Member 
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It’s a town built on the rubble of the Holocaust, which is so large. There’s obviously a lot of Jews and a lot of people who were involved in the Nazi occupation of this city, which ended in the East German and the Soviet Union. There’s also a very strong Jewish culture, which is an important thing. It’s also a very important place to live. There’s a lot of people who survived, which is good. It’s a pleasant place to live, but in the big cities you don’t have that much freedom. You have to pay for your own street.
It’s a very interesting place, because there’s so many, there’s so many places where you can go, and there’s so many different things to do. I don’t know, I have a friend in California, he’s a teacher and he has real good music, but he’s a teacher, and he’s a teacher’s union. He’s a piano teacher, and he plays in a club, and he is a very good teacher, he’s very good to the students. When I travel, I look and see, I see an old man with the old violin. I see him playing to hundreds of thousands of people who are listening, and they’re so happy. I see it like this, “Yeah, this is good, “ and ‘cause that’s when you’re really happy. I see. I see. I look at that. It’s like the first time I’ve ever seen. I’m very happy. If you work with people who you’re not happy with, it’s always to be prepared. It’s not good to get too unhappy with people, so you have to be ready. I have sad things and I know there’s things there I can’t imagine. I’m very happy, but I’ve got sadness and I’ve got fears. I’m like, “What’s going to happen,” and I’m going to be very, very sad and very sad. I don’t want to be sad, but I want to find the good in everything, so that’s what I’m doing.
Audience member
I’m not sure if you’re thinking about this in terms of life and death.
Hector Bellerin
I’m not thinking about it in terms of death. I’m thinking about life and death. I’m thinking about the next day, which is good. I’m very happy, but I’m very sad. I’m very happy, but I’m sad. I’m very happy, but I’m sad. I’m very happy, but I’m very sad, but I’m happy.
Audience member
Yeah, and I’m going to be listening to some music there, so...
Hector Bellerin
OK, do you want to do something with me?
Audience member
I’m interested in your music as a kid because it’s quite nice to hear your music.
(music: Hector Bellerin – “Grazie (Hauptmann Är Grazie)” / applause) 
Hector Bellerin
Thank you.
Alicia Keys
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
Thank you.


Hailing from South Carolina, this man emerged as a major talent and success with his debut album, Rabbit Remix, out in 2007. In his 2011 Red Bull Music Academy lecture, the L.A. native spoke candidly about the challenges and the highs of recording and touring in the city, the influence of his early influences, and more.
Audience member    
Hi, thank you for coming down. I’m a student of yours. It’s nice to have one of your peers here. I have a question, I’m really curious about some of the things you’ve talked about because I’m sure a lot of people have this same opinion. You have a lot of influences, but I don’t know if anybody here is a musician or not. I want to know if there’s anything you’ve learned from listening to dubstep or whatever it is you’re doing right now?
Hector Bellerin     
I don’t think I’ve learned anything.
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It means everything. At the time, it was a very special place, with its iconic Berliners, its Christmas tree, and the Christmas spirit, and the atmosphere. But this is not the place to live in. I would not want to live in a place like this, to show off my clothes, or as a child. I would not want to show off my... I’m not the type to show off my clothes, or my taste, or my toys, or my stuff, because I have a lot of stuff with me and I’m very, very proud of it, but I’m not interested to show off my clothes. I’m not interested to show off my toys.
I think it’s important for me to be quiet, to be quiet when I go to work, to be quiet when I have a cup of coffee, or a beer, or something, or something, when I’m working. I think it’s very important that I not show my face to anyone. I think it’s very important that I not show my face to other people, and that I don’t show my face to anybody.
Torsten Schmidt 
Then, in terms of the company...
Hector Bellerin
I’m working in a company that’s made with a very important word there. It’s very rare to work with a company like that, because it’s a very important company, and that’s a very important company. I think it’s very important to not show this company off to anybody, because it’s something that should be hidden. I think it’s very important to show it off to your family, or whatever.
Torsten Schmidt 
On the other side of it, you’ve always been a very open-minded person. You’ve always supported yourself and been extremely open-minded.
Hector Bellerin
You’re right. I’m very, very lucky to be doing what I am doing. I didn’t want to be an artist, because I’m not a good artist. I don’t like to be in a studio, because I don’t like to work with people, and I’ve done a lot of projects, some very good projects, and I’ve done some very bad ones. But I think, you know, I’ve always supported myself, and I’ve always tried to be open-minded and try to support people.
Torsten Schmidt 
That’s of course to be expected from someone who’s so high-level, and you’re in a company that’s made of a very important word.
Hector Bellerin
I think that’s the way it was. I think that’s the way it was... I don’t like to work with people that I don’t like to work with, that I don’t like. I don’t want to be in a studio, because that’s... I think that’s a very good thing to do. I think I’m very fortunate, because I have the opportunity to work with people that I want to work with, and I’m able to work with people that I want to work with.
Torsten Schmidt 
What do you think about the fact that you’ve got a company that you work with, which is very influential in the UK, and in a way, I think it’s also very important, and I think something that’s really important for us, is that you don’t say ‘I’m having trouble,” to somebody who’s not working with you, because you’re not in a situation where they’re working with you.
Hector Bellerin 
I think it’s important that you work with people that you want to work with, and that you can trust. If you work with someone who doesn’t trust you, you only work with them once you trust them. If they don’t trust you, then it’s a conundrum. That’s the way I think it should be.
Torsten Schmidt 
Obviously you have a very different approach to working with people, than you do with a studio. In terms of that, do you think about what happens when you’re working with people you don’t know, and they’ve done a really good job in the past? Do you think about things that might be a problem with that?
Hector Bellerin 
I think about it
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Well, there are only two things I want to say. One is that I’ve been in Berlin for 11 years. It’s a city where I feel like I’m a part of the collective, where people are coming together in a way that I don’t know. It’s a democracy. It’s a very small city. It’s not a big city like Paris. It’s not like New York, or Tokyo, or something like that. It’s very small. And I feel like I’m part of it, because I’ve lived in Berlin for my whole life. Not just for the last three years, but for my whole life.
Audience Member
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
I’m very happy to have my daughter here in Berlin. Is that okay?
Audience Member
Sure. And if I can see you later, that’s a great opportunity.
Hector Bellerin
I’m glad to say that it’s coming. It’s coming.
Audience Member
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah. I know. And I’m glad to be here.
Audience Member
Thank you. All of the things you talked about, you have not forgotten. I’ve been listening for ages. And I’m just wondering, what do you think is the important thing for new musicians to do? What’s a good way to start? When are we going to hear about this?
Hector Bellerin
It’s really important to be good. Because you have to be good to your fans. Because I’m not going to say you have to be good to yourself. It’s really important to know what you want to say, and what you feel about something. There’s no right or wrong way to do it. That’s the truth. There’s no right or wrong way to get good. It’s all about listening, and it’s all about understanding your audience, and listening to what they’re doing. Your audience is your ticket. If you can’t appreciate it, don’t do it. If you’re feeling it, don’t do it. Listen, and respect it. There’s no right or wrong way to do it. You just have to get it.
Audience Member
We’re going to hear about this one, is this one for you?
Hector Bellerin
Yeah.
Audience Member
Thank you. I don’t know if this is the one that really came to mind. What do you think about the old school, the jazz-funk stuff? What do you think about that?
Hector Bellerin
It’s not like that. It’s coming. You know, wherever it comes, it’s coming. Jazz-funk is coming. There’s no stopping it. There’s no stopping it. It’s coming. There’s no stopping it. I think jazz-funk is not coming anywhere. It’s coming. Jazz-funk is coming. I think jazz-funk is coming.
Audience Member
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Audience Member
Thank you. This is a great opportunity, because you’re going to be here in Berlin. What is it about it that makes it so special? It’s a very interesting city, because there’s no music there. It’s not like New York, or Paris. It’s not like Tokyo, or something like that. It’s really a very unique city, and that’s a very important thing. It’s a very unique city. And you know, it’s getting more and more important that there’s no money in the music industry in this city. There’s no clubs. There’s no clubs, and then there’s nothing. That, it’s very important for me to be able to come here and play music. I’m going to play music and be able to have a good time. I’m going to be a part of it. And I want to let you know that I’m very happy to be here and I’m glad to be here.
Hector Bellerin
You’re welcome.
Audience Member
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
No, you’re welcome. [appl
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It’s a city, it’s a beautiful city.
Audience Member
Everywhere I go I feel like there’s a lot of people, most of the people I meet are from Berlin.
Hector Bellerin
Yes, I know.
Audience Member
I have a question. By the way, I was just wondering, maybe you gave us a hand or something? You said you were at a party, but you’d be at a party.
Hector Bellerin
Yes.
Audience Member
I was just wondering, like, what is it about Berlin that is so special and so unique?
Hector Bellerin
The city is very special. We are always surrounded by nature. It’s just that simple. The city is so beautiful, it’s almost like a cathedral. We have so many beautiful things. I think in the whole history of music, there’s only been four cities. Where were you? There’s three big cities. I think in Berlin, there’s only been four cities. I think in New York, there’s only been four cities. It’s very special.
Audience Member
I was just wondering, if you have a favorite... What do you love about the city?
Hector Bellerin
I think it’s very important to have a person who is passionate about music, who believes in it. If not, there’s no music. It’s just... It’s your cell phone, you can’t go anywhere. [applause]
Audience Member
Are you talking about the city, or are you talking about the people?
Hector Bellerin
I mean, it’s a city, and it’s a beautiful city.
Audience Member
I think it’s a very special place. Can you tell us a bit about what you do in the city?
Hector Bellerin
I don’t know. I’ve been to Berlin a lot, and I love the city, and I have a great relationship with the people there. I mean, there’s no feeling like it, and I just love it. I was there, I saw the city, and I felt like I was in a cathedral, and it’s beautiful.
Audience Member
I was just wondering, if there was a place that you’d like to go to for a night out?
Hector Bellerin
No. I’m not going to do it. I don’t know. I’m not going to do it. But I always like the city. I like the people there. I like the people who live there. But I don’t like the place I’m in now.
Audience Member
I have a question. I wanted to know if you could tell us a bit about your life in between making music and being a DJ, because it seems like you’re always working on something new. You’ve been doing gigs, and you’ll be coming back to your DJing and your DJing for a while.
Hector Bellerin
I think I’m going to be doing a show in Berlin for a while. I’m going to be doing a show in New York for a while. I’m going to be doing a show in Prague in the summer. But I’m going to be doing a lot in Berlin because I know that we’ve been doing a lot in Berlin. I know that I’m going to be doing a lot in New York, because I know that I’m going to be doing a lot in Prague.
Audience Member
The last time you played in Berlin was in the ‘70s, and I think that was...
Hector Bellerin
Yes, I think that was the last time I played in Berlin.
Audience Member
And the people who are coming to these shows, they’re going to be people who are going to be coming to your shows.
Hector Bellerin
Yes, and I know that we’re going to be doing a lot.
Audience Member
I think it’s important to have a good DJ. Can you tell us a bit about your DJing experience in Berlin?
Hector Bellerin
I think we’d have to put it this way: I was always a DJ. I would always choose to go out and start DJing. I like being DJ. I like going out, I like doing music. I like to know what I like to do. I like
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It’s a place that’s about being. It’s a place where you’re a little bit in the moment. It’s a place where you have a lot of things going on. In the beginning of the night, you can feel like you can hear the church bells. In the end of the night, when you go back to the house, you can hear the church bells. When you’re in the city, you can hear the sound of the streets. When you go to the hotel, when you go to the nightclub, you can hear the sounds that are happening in the city. That’s the point where you can think, “There’s no such place as this,” or, “Maybe there’s a place,” or, “Maybe I can go to sleep at night.” I don’t know, I just think about it.
Audience Member 
I’m a 30 year old woman, and I am a very conservative person, so I don’t think I’ll go to concerts or see movies or anything like that. I don’t want to be influenced by what’s happening in the city, because I don’t think it’s going to be that good. But I think what is important is to think of your life as a journey, and you’re going to make it.
Hector Bellerin
It’s not so important, I don’t think. There’s just a lot to think about. It’s just a way to meet up and be with your friends. I don’t want to be influenced by what’s happening in the city, because I don’t think it’s going to be that good.
Audience Member
I just wanted to know what it’s like to live in Berlin and to be in a place like that.
Hector Bellerin
The first time I was in Berlin, there was nothing in the city. It was a mostly closed town, with like 10,000 people. There was no street lights, no traffic. There was no coffee shops, no coffee shops, no restaurants. There was a garage, which has a lot of people living in it. It’s a very isolated place. It’s a place where you can just be in your apartment and you can just be the last person to leave the car at the end of the day. It’s a very different kind of living environment. You can’t have a car, you can’t go to the airport, you can’t go to the subway or the bus or anything like that, you can’t even have a taxi. You just have to go to the subway in the middle of the night, so you can’t do that. When you go to a restaurant, you can’t have a cup of coffee or a drink, you can’t have a coffee or a drink to go. I don’t know, maybe we can drive to the train station, but it’s just like, “This is too far away.” I don’t know, I can’t understand the question.
Audience Member
Thank you.
Hector Bellerin
Thank you.
Audience Member 
I want to know if you could tell us an example of a male who's just been there for 20 years in a small town in Germany and he’s just been there for 20 years.
Hector Bellerin
I can’t think of any, but a lot of guys there, there are guys that have been there for 18 years or 17 years, so they’re not up to so much as a 007 or anything. I don’t know about 007, but I don’t know what kind of man would be in the next actor, what kind of actor would be in the next production. I don’t know, I think you just have to be in your element. I think if you go to a movie, you have to do your thing, but if you go to a club, you have to do your thing on the dancefloor. I think if you go to a club, you have to do your thing during the movie. They’re there for you, so they’ll be comfortable. I think if you go to a club, you have to do your thing during the movie. It’s like to find yourself in the right place at the right time, because then you’ll do what you need to do. It’s like to find yourself
====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It means change and it means growth. If you want to change the world, if you want to change the world, you have to change the world. If you want to change the market, you have to change the market. If you want to change the culture, you have to change the culture, change the way you live. If you want to change the way you think, you have to change the way you think. If you want to change the way you feel, you have to change the way you feel. If you want to change the way you look at yourself, you have to change the way you look at yourself. If you want to change the way you think, you have to change the way you think. If you want to change the way you see and feel, you have to change the way you look at yourself. If you want to change the way you interact with your partners, you have to change the way you interact with your partners. If you want to change the way you look at your body, you have to change the way you look at yourself. If you want to change the way you interact with your body and how you feel, you have to change the way you interact with your partners. 
If you want to change the way you see yourself, you have to change the way you see yourself. If you want to change the way you see yourself, you have to change the way you feel about yourself. If you want to change the way you see yourself, you have to change the way you interact with your partners. It cannot be about you, it cannot be about your attempts to change the world, it cannot be about your attempts to change the world. Change the world, change the people, because if you want to change the people, and if you want to change the people, you have to change the people. 
Torsten Schmidt
And just so we are clear, what has been the biggest influence in the last year that has changed you in a positive way?
Hector Bellerin
The biggest influence in the last year has been my wife. My wife, she was born and raised in Germany. She is a carpenter. She has always been interested in things. She always wanted to be there when I needed her, so that is always something that has been important to me. My wife, she is a very strong woman. She is very strong. She is very strong. She is a girl that has been in the world, she is a woman that has worked in the world. She is a very strong woman, but she is a woman that has taught me how to be strong, with all of my strength. I think one of the things that is the biggest influence of all of that, is that she has always done things for me. When I was around her and she taught me to be strong, she always made me think big, so that is really what I have to say. The big things that I have learned from her. She has always made me think big, so I think that is what has made her so strong, because that is what I have to say to all of you. I think that is what I have to say to any of you, because that is what will help you, is that I know that when you have a wife that is strong, that is the best thing in the world, because it is the thing that will help you to be strong. 
Torsten Schmidt
So maybe we should talk a little bit about yourself?
Hector Bellerin
I think that you have to understand, that is why I say, you have to have your dreams. If you want to be strong, you have to have dreams. If you want to be brave, you have to be brave. If you want to be strong, you have to have dreams. If you want to be courageous, you have to make a decision. If you want to be smart, you have to be smart. If you want to have a good life, you have to have a good dream. If you want to be smart, you have to be smart. If you want to be brave, you have to be brave. If you want to be brave, you have to make a decision. At the end, you have to make a decision. And you have to make a decision about your dreams, because you have to make a decision about what you want to do with your life. If you want to be strong, you have to be strong for others. You have to be brave. 
Torsten Schmidt
So in terms of your dreams and what you want to do with your life, what was the biggest moment you ever had in your life?
Hector Bellerin
The moment was very good, because I reached my goal. I was a carpenter, I was a carpenter, I was a carpenter, I was a

It means a lot, but it is so much more than that. It is, in a way, a time of great beauty. It’s so beautiful, so beautiful. When I was growing up, I always loved music and always wanted to see the world, so that I can be with my family and be with my friends, that’s what I was doing.
You have great things to do, and you can’t be in a place where you think everything is going to be better than it is. You can’t be in a place where you think the world is going to be better than it is. You can’t be in a place where you think everything is good, and that is a place where you have to find your own way. In my case, I just didn’t want to be in a place where I was thinking, “This is the best music ever.” I just wanted to be in a place where I was just happy to be here. I just wanted to be happy. I just want to be happy.
Todd L. Burns
What’s the meaning of being in a place where people can’t take you seriously?
Hector Bellerin
Well, it’s hard to get there. You can’t get there and be like, “I’m going to be a rock star,” but when you go there, you have to realize, “I’m not going to be a rock star.” You have to realize that it’s a lot about the people that you meet there. People who are hard working, people who are not like, “I have to work really hard,” or, “I have to keep working.” You have to realize that you are not going to be a rock star. And it’s not fun to be working in a place where you have to work really hard to get there. You want to be happy and you want to be happy because that’s how you’re going to make life better.
Todd L. Burns
You were talking about how you feel like the kids in the neighborhood that you grew up in had no respect for you, or as a young man, no respect for you.
Hector Bellerin
I know, you’re like, “What’s wrong with you?” I did not know people who had respect for me. I just wanted to be happy. I just wanted to be happy. I just wanted to be happy. I just wanted to be happy.
Todd L. Burns
So you had to sort of get a bit of respect in order to get to where you want to be, right?
Hector Bellerin
Yeah. I don’t know if it was like that or not. I don’t know if it’s still so much that people have to respect people. I just wanted to be happy. I wanted to be happy. I just wanted to be happy.
Todd L. Burns
So what kind of people were you talking to?
Hector Bellerin
I think I was referring to the people who were working for a lot of the major labels, and who were making a lot of money out of me, and who were always trying to make a record and they were always trying to do it the right way, like putting on a good show. They were always trying to do it in a way that I would like to do it. I wanted to be able to be happy with my art, for a long time, and not be in a place where people are going to take me seriously, because that’s going to be the hardest thing to do and I want to be able to do it in an artistic way.
Todd L. Burns
When you were talking about being in a place where people you didn’t know, or who were just trying to do that, were going to take you seriously, was it just that people weren’t paying attention, or was it just that people weren’t listening to you?
Hector Bellerin
I think I was listening to more than people listening to me. I think I was listening to more than people listening to the music I did, I think I was listening to more than people listening to the music I was making, because then I was able to be creative. I was able to be creative. I think that’s like the next step in life, and I’m not going to tell you what’s good or bad, but I do think that’s the next step in life, and I don’t want to tell you can’t do that, but that�

What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
It’s my home, in Berlin.
Audience Member 
And what do you think is important for the Berlin record industry to be aware of?
Hector Bellerin
That’s what I think. It’s a process of listening, listening to your records, listening to your music, listening to your artists. If you’re a producer, if you’re a DJ, if you’re a DJ, if you’re an artist – if you have a record in your name, if you have a label, if you have a label and you’re not playing, then you need to be aware of what is going on in the world. There’s no one thing, everything is linked to the people that you work with or you work with, but if you don’t know what is going on, then it’s not that much of a creative space. I think a lot of people are working in the club because it’s the same people that play on [the records] that are playing in clubs. I think what is really important is, when you have a record in your name, it’s really important to know what you are working with. Don’t be afraid to ask for a remix, don’t be afraid to ask for a recording, don’t be afraid to ask for something. Don’t be afraid to ask for a mastering, don’t be afraid to ask for something. If you have a record in your name, it’s really important to know what is going on in your own home, it’s really important to know where your money is going to come from.

Hi, I have a question. I know you’re a producer, I know you’re a DJ in Berlin. I’ve heard from some people that you used to buy CDs. I also know you had a label, I know you had a label in Berlin. I feel that you’re doing something special in Berlin because you are so close to the people as well. I mean, you’re a musician, you’re a musician. You have a city and you have a people, and I know you have a label, I know you have a label in Berlin. But I’m wondering if you have any regrets, what would you do differently in Berlin?
Hector Bellerin
I would say, I would say I wouldn’t be afraid to ask for a remix, because I know that’s what I would do, I would ask for a remix. I mean, I know that’s what I would do, I would ask for a remix. I’m also familiar with writing too, so I want to be honest. If I spent money, I would spend money on a writing department. If I spent money on a mastering department, I would spend money on a mastering department. If I spent money on a DJ, I would spend money on a DJ. I’m also familiar with training – I’m a training engineer. I’m familiar with training. I have a lot of experience with training.
We’re talking about people who have very many years of working in music. We’re talking about people who are trained, we’re talking about people who have a lot of experience. It’s good to have a lot of experience, but if you don’t have the experience, you’re not going to have the skills. If you don’t have the training, you’re not going to have the skills. I think what I will do is, I’ll let them do their thing, I will hold them accountable. I will do the best possible thing for them and I’ll try to help as much as I can.

Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
I mean, let me say this: The only thing that I have to say about Germany is that, if you have a lot of money, you can be very successful. If you have the time, you can make a living. There’s no American market for and if you have the time, you can do what you want with your money. If you don’t have the money, you don’t have to worry too much about what you want to do. If you can’t do anything with it, you can’t achieve anything. The idea of money is not important, it’s about creativity and what you want to do. I think about the same thing with all things. You know what I mean? I think about the idea of money, it’s not important. It’s about creativity. It’s about what you want to do with your money. It’s about what you’re going to do with it. A lot of people in the music business are doing the wrong thing. They’re not thinking about what they want to do with their money. It’s a kind of entertainment, it’s a kind of entertainment, it’s not a business. I think about that. I mean, it’s a business, it’s a business, it’s not about music. If you can’t make it in the music business, then you will be destroyed, because you have to be very good at what you do and you have to be an entertainer. It’s not about what you’re doing. It’s about what you want to do. I think that’s a very important point. I think that’s important for people to know. It’s not about what you’re doing, it’s about what you want to do. You know what I mean? It’s about what you want to do.
Audience Member 
You mentioned how you had a lot of problems with the industry, with the labels, and also with the music industry, because you were in a band, you were in a band with this guy George Michael, who was a great drummer for you, but you have this really great album, but you’ve never done a record, and you’re in the midst of a divorce, your wife is divorced, your kids are divorced, and you’re in a band, and you’re living on your own. What do you think of all that?
Hector Bellerin
Well, like I said, it’s a business, it’s a business. It’s a business. It’s a business is very difficult to work in, so it’s very important to find a good balance between the different things. Sometimes you can’t do it. Sometimes it’s just too easy to get in the music business and have too much money, too much money. It’s just too easy to go to music business and be successful.
Audience Member 
What are your thoughts about the divorce of your wife and your kids, and how have you been affected by that?
Hector Bellerin
Divorce is a very, very difficult thing to deal with, because you have to be very careful. When you’re divorced, you don’t have to worry about your money. You don’t have to worry about your family, you know what I mean? You don’t have to worry about your children. You just have to worry about your own situation. It’s very, very difficult to deal with, because it’s so personal. It’s very difficult to deal with in a business. It’s very hard to deal with in a business. If you have a good business partner, it’s not going to be difficult to live with him or her. It’s going to be very difficult to deal with in a business. We’re very lucky, because we live in the United States, we’re very fortunate. I don’t think any of you guys here in the studio, we have to go through this. I don’t think any of you guys have gone through this, but we’ve been through it, we’ve been through it. I think it’s very important.

How does your family feel about it?

====================
Todd L. Burns
What does Berlin mean to you?
Hector Bellerin
Well, I think Berlin is a very important place for me because it’s a really close-knit, small, multicultural city, there’s no problems in the neighborhood. There’s no violence, there’s no racial tensions. The police are not in the neighborhood, and there’s no problems with the school. I like this city, because it’s very beautiful. I like the history of the city, there’s no problems in the neighborhood.
Jeremy Harding
I’m curious, do you even have a date for this one or...
Hector Bellerin
No, no, I don’t. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I’m going to come back in a year. I’m going to be here. I’m going to work with the foundation. I’m going to do everything, so it’s really important to me to come back.
Jeremy Harding
I think this is the first time you’ve ever worked with a foundation, so it’s pretty incredible to know that you’ve been involved for so long.
Hector Bellerin
Yes, thank you.
Jeremy Harding
I’m also curious, just how long is it going to take you to do this?
Hector Bellerin
I think it’s going to take me about two years, I think three or four years, to finish this project.
Jeremy Harding
And you’re not going to raise money for yourself, right?
Hector Bellerin
No, no, I will not. I think that’s a mistake. I think it’s a stage. I’m not going to be a producer and I’m not going to be a rapper, I’m not going to be a producer’s assistant. I’m going to be a part of the foundation, I’m going to do everything, so we’re going to be very successful. It’s not going to be successful because the money is not there.
Jeremy Harding
But you have the chance to work with people that are very important to you, like RZA, and stuff? What are you going to do?
Hector Bellerin
I’m a part of the foundation, I’m going to do everything. I’m going to do everything.
Jeremy Harding
Do you think you’re going to be doing all the music?
Hector Bellerin
Yeah, I’m going to be doing all the music.
Jeremy Harding
I know that was not an issue for you because it was...
Hector Bellerin
It was a different situation, but I was not prepared to be on the road. I felt a lot of pressure, and I was a young kid and I wanted to go out and be famous, and I wanted to do it in the city, so I’m going to be here and work with the foundation. I’m going to stay here. I’m going to be very grateful to be here.
Jeremy Harding
I guess it was your first experience working with a foundation or something like that, was kind of a weird experience, wasn’t it?
Hector Bellerin
Yes, my first experience working with a foundation was working with the DJ Deeon, and there’s a lot of DJ Deeon in the foundation, and there’s a lot of people in the foundation. It’s like a club, it’s a nightclub, and I think I have a lot of respect for Deeon. I think he’s very respectful to us and we respect him.
Jeremy Harding
We’re going to have a question from the audience.
Audience member
Hi, I just want to know what you thought about being in a band, because it’s a tough thing to have to go through, a lot of people have said that you’re in a band and you’re being a member of the band, but this feeling, the feeling when you get in a band like that, and you’re in a band, you get in a band with other people that you’re working with, you have to be a part of a team, and you have to work really hard to be a part of a team, because even if you’re the best rapper, you have to work hard to be a part of a team. Like I said, I’m not going to be a producer and I’m not going to be a rapper, but I’m
