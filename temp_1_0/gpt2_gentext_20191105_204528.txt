There are a lot of different personalities that - I’ve just done like -”people are familiar with in this room and that mostly over there now is Dr. Akron as well. He’s nice to work with and has that kind of rock n' roll flavor. That typically has a long name just those names. He has done a lot of amazing records and he’s a very good specimen of Penthouse music. There’s a reason behind that. It’s more of a protest thing than a punk spanish thing that is tame in comparison. People here are going here, it’s going to be like the Italian house thing coming back.

I don’t know if they got the album coming out, boy you’ve got to give it their space. It’s strong, it’s versatile. However, I don’t think any of us here has folks, I’ve got dozens crew before this due to all our sessions, three years on there. That was going to be there.

People need to understand sometimes there’s going to be people in the streets that want to organize an uprising. Just because it’s over. It’s done. It’s gone. The audience wants to go home, and I feel even more tired of being around these kinds of
people now making festival out of it because I can’t even carry the workload, in a way, I have six or seven friends that work with us, and I’m looking to those individuals to do it
in this very concrete kind of way. That’s why I feel very cautious, sometimes because we have these groups and we’ll say, “No, we don’t want to get into the picture,” we’ll make this thing pretty rigged and exact a routine and that’s it. It just doesn’t have a very satisfying timeline.
Thankfully, we’ve still got ten more weeks of days left and I’m not interested, even opposed to my own personal end with some things. The fact that I can still play with these people is good. I’ll get in knowing that all each of them are coming to one door on time and do what they need to do to make sure they know they’re there on time. For show on time anyway, within 10 minutes, 10,000 in the gym, 50s, 60s from yesterday, then we’ll do it. Didn’t do any yesterday.
Yeah, this got to end, I know, “Run a gauntlet out there.” Cool. Everything is one. I don’t care which one you were getting. Just nothing. Then we’ll get processed and packed up, and go out the door. People here are people here. Hitting my point, “Run a gauntlet out the door.” Never give excuses for the audience or before what they want to go to and do their thing. Give them something to feel good about. Give them something to feel good about, so they can process it, they can feel good, they can get emotional. That’s what I send out, Captain Crunch is the way of throwing weight around. Yeah, he’s my man, I goes out every day and I’m here.<|endoftext|>Posted 12 January 2012 - 07:41 PM
BlueSkies, 
Hello! My name is BlueSkies. I’m from Industry City Ranch.
I knew one of the base of G4. So, with this launch date, I really want you to be able to enjoy what the G4 is about, what you appreciate about its brand. Right from the design of the G4, straight to the software. With two so-called dynamics that surround the G4, I believe it travels like its, because I want the product to be trusted by you, the consumer.
The major thing is you have a digital way of communication and that’s not that latest, that’s not that all-conquering, but was just a lot more dominant than it became. This has me always looking at the G4, just because this is not the next hot thing, it sways it but has its ability to give you that hip-hop, and lets’s laugh at yourself, at all this, is it?
But another story, another process, I would believe because it has this opportunity to be your much old-fashioned way of making music. No matter how
====================
when i’m showing off my shit,
sometimes i’m like, oh nah, nawggggg,, but then my mother used to tell me, like, “Look, let me give you some paint.
“I like this last line so much, “okay.” “Daleb, what the fuck. “I’ll do it.” “Gonna be the best thing,
you know what I’m saying, right?” “Hey! Why did you do build that up?” “Oh right to be mad, you know what I’am saying?” “I can’t be serious, I don’t have to show my shit, I’m supposed to come back?” ”Ah, yeah, if you don’t want to know your own shit, you ain’t trying to bash it, ”thank you.” “I’m back from Iraq, ‘m4...” “i’m too chicken, I’m too old, “yeah, like I said, I just saw J.J. Jethro and 39th Street gonna help me finish, should see some hot spots to be out there talking
duh-duur, yeah.” “Retail, sellout, I’m like, nah, he need to know his own shit, just go get to and see his aunts, Don’t do hi-fi, take a stereo and just go fatter and fatter.” “Past time, super buildin’ right?” “Yes sir, yes sir, yeah.” “Need some shots of your pride fuck, yes, sir! Like my mother looked at me when I was getting off the plane, sometime in 1992 here, a wife was coming out of the Atlanta Aviation Museum, “You back with our dog, wouldn’t you happen to be at home and we can have a view?” Check this folks, do something for her, you know what I’m sayin”? I wasn’t too big to fuck with, FYI. “daily, I need to go to work.” “daily, I balance. I’m a bodybuilder. Always on the extra hours, I look back and say, you know what I am sayin’? Watch TV, I guess. We don’t get to eat and watch TV, that’s enough, because you need a pair of shoes, we threat, we try to beat yo’ navel, and then you go out of the shop, or you wake up in there, because that’s just how it needed to be. That’s how I knew, I ignore people that are on television, if they can’t see or can’t hear, we shut them down and go back to the shop. Never really went out eat and watch TV, but at the end, like I said, if she wants her son back, him be fresh crack drug free.” “retire and get in this crazy car, nigga, let’s do one, we’ll ring the bell sometimes.” “every minute, don’t worry about money, just feel good when you drive home, no questions, just go home, ‘cause this is... this is how we was in Emory, folks. Try not to feel too happy. With our great hood
of Chicago, we had Wolves at home, Wolves at home. But if someone talks
pleasant hip-hop, go home Lions.” I just have that brother are out to be proud…

And more importantly, a road trip are coming, when Jared comes back from his trip, he will say I am a liar, “I know you did a trip, but you never saw the door, you never bought label, you never signed one, you think your cut, who cares, but you see an opportunity, I ain’t giving a shit, you just get every beat.” So Jared said he did all things like a bruv. “Isn’t there another way out than to stop and customer the world?” He had great luck with Roc-A-Fella, The Global Family, Ed. July and Mr. Woll, Nas, Storm, Blood Money, **** maybe before he died, Bible Belt of old school Bronx, Terri Lee. All those groups that came through. “Why did you stop? Don’t you feel it? Don’t you feel something?” Don’t you feel good when you ride the bus
====================
A new generation of retro electronic music is on the horizon with The Hiss Club. Dubstep looks to break the shackles of supply chains and PsyPho pushes ahead with thin, beautifully arranged techno and dance-centric house that takes ambient to the extreme.
This annual festival evokes memories from Europe which were only again opened up for dance music years after years of relative obscurity. What was it about this style of electronic music that appealed to so many? The music was a melancholy reverie, refined disco elements with hypnotic melodies, followed with synthesizers in turned records, funky basslines and a lot of tape machines. It exhibits a very oldschool approach in dubstep and close-simmered basslines, but it was always there with them. 
In translation and ‒rounds and circles and squares and fa-'til the end of the night and I find your end and I good and I love you,” as they say.
________________________________________
Markus Landers was an artist not only echoing with his early records, he was also one of the pioneers in working with tape. Even with that in mind, it is the kind of dub music that has soundtracks at the moment and which helped dubstep get so much further than it ever could. In the film Mud Courtney, he raises a crying baby for the director during the music. 
Have you got here yet, folks?
I mean when you check out the: “Flux Five,” you know how to shuffle through it and all that kind of stuff, it was enough to get me soooo much more into music, but back then you did start to watch the movie Fashion and you’d do two movies with Benny Polimi.  Chip Snickerdoodle, you had a rap this old punk band, you did a record with the same artist all over the music.  I guess there was some people—just your usual dubstep crowd. There was interesting folks out there in Melbourne.  Rom Gordon had a high school, he knew me from high school and in college did music for Bro Safari, Bro Safari.  And then he had a sick loser like Big Dada D.  But that house and the other ones were coming back, too. There was just so much fresh shit and trash. 
JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO 
Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Markus Landers 
Well obviously there’s still music coming out. Other people're mixing up the labels now. There’s a couple of people who are faking up the titles but the main ones are up there listening.  However, I did have two records from rappers who were still in the game, sketches and chaps that we used to sneak into the shop, we worked out a few more lines, myself and Falla came out with the freestyle, and I had the snare thing, I never really liked the snare, it wasn’t as flashy, but someone could do a VO- guy and they could do a drop and that would bruise a summery sound. It wasn’t done in rhyme but beats which I always liked, “Bossy” Calibre, and that was probably knows all I knew.  There’s another record from some guy from New York, he uses again a voice mode? He used to write warm up vocals. When I hear that I think about him as being in a studio, well that’s another quint, we were always in the studio, sometimes you get into it a bit, and we wouldn’t have come out with records that way, since we didn’t have the cash, we didn’t have the budget to go into a song two months in advance or three months in advance and get it done or something like that. 
That’s where I decided to house and to treat my instruments as house and not as like a dirty record or even like a dirty beat. We tried to house anyway, much harder stuff. But we’re not into quaffers, we just don’t have that drive, we get into the mums and don’t have that need on an album. It’s strange, because one time Rocko got into one of these experiments, I thought it was cool, but it turns out it wasn’t.  I don’t know what they did for the music thing, they just catered something like Halloween, so they had me write that, and that’s.  Yeah, what is happening here is they got me designing tapes, and I’ve worked them to death.  As you said, these records were the oldest ones we had in Melbourne, kids who had been clothing shopping this long. I don’t know that Weezer or Shade 66 were trying to play back then because that kind
====================
First you open your eyes as it seems billions of people are everywhere. Then there’s a phrase like “Metal,” people trying to be innovative to keep people interested. But the idea of a brick welder like Richard is because today there is a new one with looks and it’s expensive, so those behind the producing of puzzle pieces places art for promoting their music. It was not something that we saw, that we could fully adopt the topic until now. It’s always bringing tragedy and worse to cinema, comedy, parodies of tragedy and hello world. Now bars around the world is changing voice. The problem comes with Creativity competition of telling more of with each joke. A lot of also something artistic. The problem is always working same technique more and more instrumental. Also because’s the thing. I think this will be happening with music in the future because if they tell a six-foot tall guy to play the guitar one-half of a man, people can watch, if they do a movie featuring lights, they know close.
Now there’s so much less of it about the great instrumental or an audience, it’s a little trashier. They tell more well. It’s not enough. You cannot just be a film, but at the same time you have to keep that silent feel, it’s very valuable because nowadays people have mobile phones and they made a video video that can come out for minutes just hitting basically again and now with thanks to the Internet Open 24/7, they can have music video on the corner and videos of different places, where people would like to go to dance with, have live video, play video of the location. It’s amazing how they feel, how a lot of people can connect. They move the music, of course people use to be making music to make music, work with musicians, they’re not selling. Back in 1979 when we were talking I’m thinking that they can’t only work with one song, they can’t work with chordals, we can sell “Can You Feel it,” that should be tracked like piano and the people are sold out, then there’s this idea of success, it’s between video, theater or something. It’s between the platform and, of course an audience, it’s nothing. At the same time,
sometimes things. It’s magic, usually it’s everything. In the stage show maybe people remember the audience, so I’m, I’m a musician, you get different shows. We need a platform to show different TV show from every other movie that you watch every night, first could the audience is something. It’s only strange, when you love it for... Three, 50 or 70 people, they’ll love an idea, but that’s almost impossible.”
Lastly, I think the audience is very important, sometimes we get people who think 4 to 5 feet fiveness. Don’t get excited because then it’s... “Do you feel more like you could see?,” because it shouldn’t be a show. 
But James Murphy is a fictional character. Sometimes I feel, these crazy, surreal movies I could really say can be intelligent, but James Murphy wasn’t that person. He was the opposite of James, where it’s like not so different from puzzle to solve puzzle. I think a lot of us are unhappy with the industry today and it’s no different than what you have in 21st century. We should see something. We should see the people and people take care, we live the art, yes, we discuss it.

Yeah, I’ve never seen such a lack of reverence from any audience and musicians for freedom against fact that today, the media is treated as barista when something you say or controversial. Of course, it’s an international experience, it’s manufactured with color, two people doing existent. It doesn’t have any emotion for anybody. It’s the normal way were believe something to be dangerous to us or whatever. It’s we’re in a strip club as opposed to going to a club or it should be bigger. Now every I trusted, although when we offered free music to people over 20 I saw earlier shame and gratitude in air conditioned, but that’s definitely not the kind of people are marrying today, it’s more like they could tell you’ll die, they’re happy with their millions nowadays. For details, David Bowie did this in Munich. First we look for details to go for the contrary, not concerned. There services don’t work like demos, we

I remember Oklahoma City like this. It was a very, very professional team, OKC Thunder, Pistons, by the way, wins. And I said, “OK, we hear about this team.” I’m not sure if I’m a slave to what I was used to in Oklahoma City or in Miami or in Texas or Dallas, but you’re getting what I’m talking about. I think he heard mine. It had the concave.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
Or does it just believe in an improvisable style, does it? Can you explain behind that?
CARL Anderson
Well, for sure, it was older. The studio, they’re all older. [laughs] They saw each other dying, and they looked at each other and said, “Yeah, this is a great soundsystem.” And it needed to be live. And it was hard. I mean, it started to blow down too soon. OKC Thunder wins, OKC Thunder gets an amazing car. Oklahoma City starts to do that all the time, but there always was an attitude. If you’re going to do a big show, just blow the setting down and make it bigger. And the reason why it didn’t blow up and so much of the noise in Oklahoma City, you wouldn’t have to run around all city streets. Oklahomans know, they know it is a city with a history, with stars, with Prodigy, with Ron, with Prodigy and the rest of that, because this had five gentlemen, it had a house for Prodigy and Thunder wins. And everybody was still inventive and you blew up. I thought, oh my god, OKC is rockin'. Not to mention, and this has nothing to do with the car, Thunder steals music and starts dancing with her, and after that they come to tears, and so everyone will be dancing too. And the whole anti-hero thing, Thunder worthy is hits the car like the end of the night on the radio, you know? They have a spray painting, best example of that. You ain’t got nothing bad to wring out, you got nothing. And the car is like, I mean, I never heard that on TV. I would just give a wave.
I mean, you tell us, OKC, OKC doesn’t believe in a lot of stuff like that, just a lot of attacks. It can’t stand up for what they do, but they are not going to win, OK City. Things where you beat out 16 or 17,000 competition like that is not going to win, OK City. So, rumbling post and all that? They think bigger. It doesn’t matter, you just have to go bigger, you can’t fight time. And it’s not about what you eat. It’s about what you paint on your house. And so there is nothing to fight for in Oklahoma City, let alone in America for that matter, you know? Where you eat, you know, Ricky P, OKC has good food, well then they will be strong and be you pray life potion genius. That was all that was going on. You’ll be good shot, home, fast, bang the shit. [laughs] And it all occurred to me you set your shit aside. You finished it, rear-end you know what I’m saying? Everything was happening before because the way you be get things to work, it just happens you catch up with them. Kraig King kept so busy. He spent a whole lot of time recording, and commercial royalty would come in, and you didn’t have to truly believe nine times out of ten. Because the case of the kidnap victim came in, but you couldn’t hide it the way landlovers used to. You just couldn’t want to do things because it was going to be credits to you all the time. Even if you get something that you ain’t got in every recording bucket, or shot it for licensing, or whatever you want to do with trailers. Kraig friends loved it, because they’s great property.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
I have attachment to it too, but what are you... It’s OK then. You’ll have names on your ship.
CARL Anderson
Yeah. Different birds in different places. [translates] So, for real, this truck was always worth more than the actual prize. There’s no way Big Boss could have got an album on 20th Century.” And Kraig leaned on Big Boss for all the songs and all of that. Kraig friends loved it, because this is when shit like the end of the Combo Murders for Jobin was talking about, and I

I love this, this stop makes so much stuff come out. A lot of people likes it, it has so much consonance.
Did you guys get the D trapezoid tape? It’s called a stop tape,
because they’re woody vinyl tapes, the big, heavy, so it doesn’t feel like a nylon or something like that. It’s pow... do you guys like it?
Audience Member 
Every time I get back to them, they still try new stuff, isn’t there? If I get back to the Back to the School Tape, I have to take it. They tried out things like the ellips Reverse Flute Tape, which I thought might make me drop...

Right, double drop. Your ears will have run out the shit, run out it. Why don’t we just have it and run over for you two? So...

We also had two tracks on the Two Hot DJs Special. These had to come right out of the stamp, we had nothing to worry about. And DJ Rivery Ripa,
found out the Back to the School tape is so huge that have you got a lot to worry about. Totally true story, dude. If you’re going have it from the Roc and Dancz… and when you’re mixing, you have your kick and bass and the instrumental, it’s gonna come out right. Don’t listen to the record if you don’t know. It alone, give you that first pass.
Audience Member
But it’s easy to get into. This is in Coldplay.

We’re going to get back to our little argument about turntables to a question, I think we all know the difference between drum and bass, we compare the impact of drum and bass records. It’s, the range of it is much larger than the roar. What makes it engulf sounds like bass drum that move like a truck. Academy. But if you’re just going to mix a record, give it a chance.
DJ Regimen 
It’s not great. The records we talk about are bass drum records that are drum kits you use on the beat, but I think when you do it, if you’re hearing something, it’s gonna be rich. So many records like Sean Breitbart’s album called ?he sucked?, he was playing like 20 - is anyone in here?

There was a time during my touring days I felt that during an interview with a musician about taking punk, I was mentioned a lot in the press because there was Ray Manzarek, Manutee is a major Haitian talking point, and you’re not speaking for an entire time. It’s in Brazil, during this era, I became at the very end here, you came in. It’s like opening lancet for the press. I have the unfortunate privilege to say that what France has, they had at these raves, if you believe in the recent past, in association with the black community… this is the most revered time and dying…
RAY MARKANZA
"On this time. This time, we have a lucky, not through the best, the best from now, but it was… We had an opportunity on this time, like, are we in money again and it will last years? But I was telling my mother the kids do not have money. The kids do not play games anymore. We were, it was a show. I don’t know how long it was during the Rwanda genocide. It was a show, if you didn’t know… This was such an accident where that happened. This was pure chance.
Tony Rockwell
We: We or the audience
We did this circuit, in the ’80s, now, we just have the internet, during this era, that you could just teleport three teenage kids in my area, and have a good band, and sit there with them, do our stuff, listen, by the way are we in a music festival like Hamburg, and what’s happening? It just happened at the exact moment. It was like: Nah, no.
English [audience member]
I ask you because there was such a political situation in your neighborhood. It was a kind of “emergency,” as they put it. It was a mess, it was a mixture of African and white. So, there that’s what makes us this test, just to see the community really come to our assistance and just told us to just play.
Curtis Cleveland
We ended up doing this for the community. It was our first concert, that was ’77, with the first ... I think it was a sellout and I won’t actually be able to tell you about the sold out concert. I like Barry White most of all. Busy times. “Cause there is Rampage, all of his boys because I’ve known Barry White, I played first Trey as well.
It was the first time the audience could get really into us. There were these kids, Black Kids USA that needed their music, and there is a label called Dopamine, they needed- at that time in ’80, there was an American label. So, they reissued the Black Kid’s Amarillán and James Brown and we took that up, and we pressed as well, and now we won’t have this Little Saigon thing, which is another headache for generations getting out in 2004 and 2007.
Mike Patton
I was going back thru your tour as well; you heard me talking, you had Harris Johnson in there. When did that happen? I was present at some show.
Curtis Cleveland
“Wasn’t?”
Mike Patton
This was ’78. Between 1971 and ’78, I was there, and I was always there, and I have never made a show because that’s where we knew, then, but I can tell you, in ’78, there were clubbangers, and there were rap groups at this time, and there were big shows. You had all the big ads, who were really popular, and you had this Egyptian drumkit. Before then, Clyde Larkin changed dinner table physics and helped spread it. I had my Haitian drum kit with all the guitars.

It was very popular, even back then it was point blank text in a party scene, and now it’s just looking like boom boom blip blips in Minneapolis. It was very in-your-face, very aggressive, with a dangerous tempo, a high rhythm and a high sampling environment combined, and I always would play them together and bring them on stage into the crowd and let people hear it bark like Korean, because it’s not the samplers – it’s live, it’s family finger euphoria.

S.O.S Blog • October 17, 2015
Today we could not be doing this without having the warehouse fires. So please use this to mark today, ’cause hundreds of people are lost, millions are without food or running water or electricity and you know, you see these acts of vandalism, people go in the woods to build barricades, and their houses get hit by cars, and they play with the protestors and the people who are trying to slow down the trucks passing through the street and you know, mob it, and drive them out into the Christmas trees – these women, that really was a big response. After the fact, I was in Pine Bluff and nothing happened. After the police was here, no one was holding the families for hundreds of dollars, and I wanted a traffic circle with a line of trucks having what they had up to their cars with chainsaws.” Everybody did that we saw the car hitting the counter, and there was a lot of people, it went over the top of a bridge. They laid over hundreds of bodies, and they had chainsaws and they just go right over the highway.
If you got 20,000 people, you better make bromance because in there was a senior citizen on the phone saying, “I'm like Wanda.” They feed the bucks, it’s an amazing thing to have them , because this is America, this is the crossroads, and when your culture goes, hey, what is becoming a utopian hyper-connected network, you tackle the problems and get it done sooner, and get it done better. If you got one for a dollar, then I’m going to bite you and say, “You make up your mind whether or not you want to back this,” and I’m going to be a working class girl.
For those outside of Jay's vocabulary – for those of you who grew up in middle America, you’ve heard of them – it was all about the savings and that's what advantage got you. Your job was to transfer. The thing that helped was, there was no affordable housing, the banks had laid over tons and tons of people. In swamp lands there was transition schools and Little League and said, “Well, you’re working and I want you to move here,” or say, “I’m a dropout and I want you to get a job,” they’d say, “We’re going to let you get some work so, come back…” Where else would you go to do these jobs? So you do three lots of jobs of season laborers and you change your Twitter feed and start a blog and then you start a baby boom. So all these transformations happened over the poverty of these women, their lack of education, their limited social structures and no social infrastructure in the first place made it easy to overcome. But a lot of work can go into that first step, and the baby boom age had raised so many people who had nothing. We thought it was the new American Dream, and then things started to get better. You’d find a business from new parents, housing would get better and new things started. I started getting ready for the future. Now people get unemployment insurance provided by somebody here in America, and they don’t have the broken bike holly that I get over in Puerto Rico, and they can use our unemployment insurance as soon as they’re free. We have a lot of of work to do creating more housing to maybe have children and stuff, and a couple of things that has so much children's needs where it’s the next step on the career ladder, and make it work.
The thing that is really interesting is that, as a producer, Dakota was like a reference point for how I could feel when I left Mississippi and head to the west coast of Texas. In Hawaii, Victoria was telling me just – from an excited culture or what Kawhi said, “I want to be an artist now, do this,” because I was in those places; now this girl doesn’t even have her shoe heels, you know, so you go out and it’s a lifestyle.
Laurie Anderson     
Is it still a lifestyle?
Jim Jones     
Yeah. I think so. I think about for a year, two months, I was homeless in big states, but I actually went to a couple of shelters in glass houses above me and I would ride around and see them in the glass condo towers. I’m not sure how long it takes two years, to make it get above [inauthentic word]. 
And I realized that in Gulf Washington, the homeless people share all my food and everybody would come and eat my food. So I was able to feed my kids, the girls that needed it

As a director of limited movements and a very good musician, you are always under pressure right?
The Siren of Africa
No. I’mbaun is my favorite Grammy winner as well. She had lyrics like “I Need You’, “I’m Fucking Running,” or when she is sampled in a video asking for love or wanting to love a lover, “I'm Pupping your Dance,” obviously, that is not the ones that I like or vice versa, because then in another song “Panther in The Rain” where she’s crying because she’s hit by a tornado. Running is so powerful, given her size it doesn’t even hit the seat, and it all works so well.

Well, we, of course have organic food. Now we… for those, I’ll tell you what we’re doing. This is Dezeen the most realistic. You need more, more colors, more things to eat. 
We all look for more. I recognize our choices, it’s become popular to play everything this homemade style, radio music. This is not like salsa, too, we have courses. At Dezeen, everyone comes and joins us in our studio.

What would you call it after dark in New York?
Michael Jackson
I have kind of sort of like night. I’m just trying to be pleasant and be grateful for what I have, just because it is here now. This is the time. I don’t mean to be tragic, but I don’t realize what to do. Like I said - and I try to be honest and take into account that things are not a total disaster. Again, I am a city that really is close to other city, very close. Like I would say, it will all work out, I don’t know if some things in New York speak to Brooklyn and Philadelphia. I don’t know if people in Philadelphia or actually New York like me because they had so much success, and black people don’t have to have to work for nothing. Like, the way you pay your rent, how you get home and you can get a different car and you can ride a train all day, I don’t know. But in some ways, it’s for you, and you pay the rent and then, you ride the bus all day and all you have to do is go the woodsy trails in the moonlight and the morning, set up camps in these old Hollywood buildings and just go to sleep. I really believe you can do that. I just don’t understand what it is about people that like us. Like, somebody will tell you, “Oh yeah, yeah, you got the right mix, you got the contacts, you got the passion, set up your hotel in the woods and you got money to run down their meds.” ... 
Duffy Gossage
You mentioned being prolific in the studio.
Michael Jackson
Literally, for the first decade of my life I was in this studio, and then maybe I can talk about it. Yeah, I was just a fine musician, and all I wanted was to be. It was not about what they liked about music, what I liked was really not a specific mix or group. I wanted to be Michael Jackson, and everything was changing. I was just another guy in Brooklyn, just trying to think of new things and feel good. That was just my vision, then of the future, but I might have really fallen down, and maybe it’s for you as well. I always didn’t make up music without feeling good and wanting to be happy. I did all my school executives and my career managers education, and I don’t know if you were in that job, too, at the time, but it was pretty straightforward, pretty easy to understand. It wasn’t about people asking you questions because they wanted something different or I didn’t necessarily write that way -- I wanted to be just… The band that I was in was really popular, but really hot-sounding and hot-stuff to work with. 
Duffy Gossage
Hmm. Well, I mean, I got to ask here, when you make a record, if you have a catalog of records on there or any kind of a--
Michael Jackson
Yes.
Duffy Gossage
I mean, you also pick a theme every record, but you like. You like demand for a record. When did you become a cheapbeat sounding record company lawyer or something like that?
Michael Jackson
That’s a tough question because maybe you were just young, and you were into music, but if I would pick a theme that people like I just make. It doesn’t really matter if it has to do with fashion or anything. I am (silver) sexy, and I don’t like to say that anyway, but if I want them to like what I am, I’m go for it. If I want them to want to want my energy, I’m a hot girl, whatever. 
Duffy Gossage
What? What would it mean to you to be a good businessman?
Michael Jackson
It’s not about being a good businessman. It’s about what we are doing with loyalty in the daytime to all the people I meet. I don’t care if people want to listen or if people want to buy whatever cheap things they can get, we don’t care whether you like whatever track you’re on or something. If I’m in the busining area, I’m pretty good. In the studio, when I go in the studio like the girls are there, and they want to see me, it’s really nice because if I “say” something wrong, it’s like right away. If I say a wrong idea on something I say, they’ll understand it faster. Get from one song to be 12 tracks, because now you just do your thing and so

Stevie Wonder 
I just didn’t really like that, the “Last Kiss” song, that was down to me with the first marriage. I brought it gay me, it kind of kind of... I wasn’t going to do a song with Paul Simonetti or something so it went straight to Stevie and me just. We just said let me tell you about the scheme and grindhouse thing, they used to be around, they don’t know anything. They just grind. You have six drummers put it in, you go out the studio and you jump at eight to 12 to get that groove back. They just honk. They used to grind fastballs and bongos just...
Gene Simmons 
They cleared something like 19 just, in 1967, or something like that. It used to be 16 or 16 drummers and the whole horn section, the whole percussion. So, what it ended up, here it is, a disco record. Her and Josh B... they got back - so they paid us $900, $900 each to go over to the synths. I used to work for...
Audience Member 
$400??
Gene Simmons 
$400 for nine hours, it would never break, but you know we just made them. They were usually on for only like 18 black people. Sometimes, you could be 12 hours there and I could barely do anything. There was a song with Jimmie Rodgers called “Sweet Child O From Hope, I Can Ripe.” I used to carry two -- man out the studio for a minute of nothing very important, coffee and chips though, the freestyle is out of this world. That is what they do, alright. That is real. That is what New York has to boast. Didn’t even... Joshua B, yes, he’s from John [Bombay, Jr., an audiophile great and a producer best known for producing albums such as Young Biz Over the West Coast and Lost In Souls - I still think of the... I used to ... you look the boy up in the dictionary to see if you could catch a few radio spots that would promote him today, but these Four Fingers always made a full house. We never had a multicamera stable. We had a little hold, you're like asking in the youth if you can drive for sure. But if it’s seven more, drop a few tapes, look at a couple of magazines and think if you can catch the message here. When we did, it never got a negative review, trust me about that. But as long as you are always white and doing your homework about doing your job. But at that time, it worked for us if your attitude was great and you were faithful to the ground you were on and you were watching the good times in LA. Freddie, that’s something with New York musicians and nothing that isn’t true to the ground. They knew that those of you in middle class America can be like jazz legend. Saying if you're going to be on the dancefloor, it was good. They are true. Happy Endings
We’re going to be in Miami tonight singing this song and we have something like an Elvis cover cover in our dressing room and we bring pizza and we’re going to eat pizza because we had pizza stolen from that house that has some of the best meat of all time, and we’re going to eat some pizza and we listen to her, we watch the tapes before and after. That’s how we got wet on a week night, I forget the name of the guy at the house, but the two of them with her, we say fuck this, a man called Sugar Ray was always going to the studio, and that man a great producer.
(music: Janet Jackson – “Spence 4 Life” / audience member comments) 
Later in the second row ends up going f---ing deaf from the soundtrack caters. We narrate the lyrics of that song ‘Spence 4 Life’ telling the story of that moment. It started off in the studio of that place, and it’s meant to be tearful or nothing, it was just tearful, little tears, but that’s the manufacture that we are, you know. We tell the story called birth. We listen to it covered with notes, adjusting and replaying that song. A couple more songs, we couldn’t get to “Spence 4 More” by Donna Summer anymore

Making docks Open Sources for Field Methods and Robots
Engineers are very focused and they love to be open source, because it means that if you have something you want to share when development is going on they can share the results and give feedback. Often times people get upset by these kinds of changes, because it makes the money and kind of fame when people try to bid on your job.
I have a feeling that people want to see this information. Also, it allows the community of equipment makers to be more involved. You have a more good looking eye and which links which, so you can have hardware in [the open source] list, particularly if somebody is under cheaper equipment to perform the same thing as you. Like a DJ or something to do it. It could be the Consensus set, a nice open source tool. We could share those tools and we just edit and picture and [create] pictures.

I think one of the amazing things about it, however, is that users and especially entities like Hasbro, which owns everybody, can be hugely supportive, but. But I suppose there still is the opportunity to use that money, that traction. There are some younger ones who can do it, but certainly it will go uphill towards the largest bass equipment. There will be responses to having all the knowledge also, which becomes the motivation to have something. Because I have seen, at the Brazilian Pirates party Portugal and Germany, basically people win, they never saw an audience, they never got great publicity and they never came to a party on the road from where people can watch motherfucking techno. It’s all very developing systems along the way.

It’s pretty unusual, I think I can recall this truly everybody is saying one thing and we would have a few things get them together, like giving people keys and all of that. That said, as a Raoul's party organ and a great-looking woodwork we thought, “Hey, we’ve got a planetarium and it’s probably over there.” Such as that. It is their Aura [Microsoft], who they still have, whenever it’s the party we come with a new key. This is The Players of Raoul is like a global, collective success. Once they joined, Hadbro responded even though they’re Northern Irish. They make money there, that’s not what was happening when Raoul was being played live. It was the opponent.
And having them collaborate knowing there’s possible outcomes and Nicky [Everton], the bands didn’t know that any of this would really be over. But to go to his house with all the families that were there, now being invited to the UK, great.
Todd L. Burns
When you describe it, for whatever reason, we combine the interest from a different audience.
Audience member
Talking about Raoul, during your Manchester rave days you saw him being chased by kids. And then at dubstep, now it’s got a completely different sound, you move into a different phase. Does that make you feel any differently about Raoul or would you prefer not to. That unique thing happens to anyone when meeting strangers, when meeting people that aren’t familiar with [inaudible] but you know the early pads, the late starts were all coming out of clubs from clubs in a totally different type of music, that’s a different world. That’s a different thing.

As an archaeologist, you might say that’s cool, but maybe you are more interested there in what’s really going on, from an archaeology perspective, if you go home in Salvador, you can’t erase the difference that there’s music already. People think we all in the same of 1,000 people or whatever. If you don’t know, if you break that seed and go to school, you know the difference, really. We are not going from the multiplicity of the sounds, to [inaudible] being a singular thing to that this is just in love, that was the pinnacle where a lot of music became interconnected. “Ah, there’s no crossroads, there is only this, and that’s it,” or whatever, but there’s a fingerprint that connects all of that to the sound of New York, and that’s something that everybody who loves disco can’t forget that. Hold on, things is happening at the same time, because little things happen, like in LA, take in the vibe and that everything changes when something’s coming out on one scene, people pick it up immediately, that’s just how it started, it change everywhere, re-living even the dru

Ubuntu has officially released the self-proclaimed alpha version of Ubuntu 13.10.
Back in late 2013 immediately after the release of Ubuntu 13.10, David Gorski spent quite some time quoting someone from a news online as saying, “I will dance to the beat of Vivaldi.”
A few years later as it is, Gazelle is an official musician. He was known as Mr. Gazelle in the ’90s.
Gazelle, within a short time, started a special team, based in the Soviet Union, the Cultural Revolution, to produce, hosting premiere independent videos, promote digitally colored music and launch both French and Swedish films, live and on-demand.
But to many, for several reasons, Gazelle kept on working with the team and started inaugurating events, workshops and parties, thatʙs very important. Not only to promote the party aspect but it increased if you have people in the German community. At the same time in or to great deep-pocketed companies like Walt Disney came to Lithuania, the viewers loved and were looking to Gazelle’s yoga films, experimental music, celebration.
Aaron Gonsher
Would you like to share some of that information, like?
David Gorski
Oh, yes. The soundtrack,, the laws the celebrating, […]
Aaron Gonsher
The responsibilities of experiencing media more, eliminating government propaganda, a civil society…

How do you deal with people who are too old? Do you have an official listening session, “Two hour piece, Laurie Ludd, I’m doing cold, the blues on the radio, we have a meeting here?” Or does the music influence you in a different way?
David Gorski
We argue. Entertainment is part of our history. Virgil. We do stunts. We go wild. Ariel Sharon. […] Everyone was a surprise guest in Poland. Marc Bolan [producer] would tell Marc Bolan. Marc Bolan  says, “I don’t buy!” “Why do you play “leave me alone” every time? Why do you play, “leave earth cat alone”? What are you talking about? All this because “I’m not a model mother.” It’s an invitation. What should I say? Did you not know the audience, not from them but from your Facebook? There are specialists who do movies and create radio, in all countries, in all sects of savage of course consume, listen to the same messages. We tend to see the same message in many forms. We see everyone at the same time or through friends, through steppplanners, the satanic movement, visit Ardennes, Spokane, the Norwegian Fall, even Hazelden releasing live lighting concert. All our tricks back on location or at the end, because in Germany, Marc, guys like Mark Tranov, you know. All these people, today, [makes] music and technological stuff, but there was hard techno in Mordor where there was this charismatic, so-called United Nations, from other continents … we produced all my films and feature films, it’s a small amount of time and, I forget, without people like Sigmund Halst, so we decided to have each radio show in Liverpool. It's just better to take shows from other countries than to buy books. I went to Spain; I went to Britain, Germany. I tried work for someone in the UAE, took part in the Hamburg Conservatorian, Rotuba.” That was at great concerts in the USA, now, we can draw today.

I bring all my photographs out in Berlin. I find that by late’90s I’m gasping for air. I take one picture from the ground, in absolute cold, which is the Vocalium party, with my surround at night, the stage was snaking in front of me, and that’s my people. That’s what grace my many stages. The movement is animated, Paralyja, and our lighting flies like rainbow. Nothing was expressed like that, while we’re feeling this, much less you, the shining average of the world gentlemen, who listen to these electronic famous musicians, only relying on the profit of the machines. I just want to be Yours, I will be Yours, I represent Martynum from the Hungarian Family, my brother Javier from Death Records, our mother Sandra. And Theresa.

Cobra lost to certain type of jazz, he had it at home. There was no money out of the house, but it brought him stability. It fed him. It kept him away from some problems, and he developed into a diamond in the rough.

That was 2000, the year that we made the video. We had the complete cycle with every album on the first night for the first 2,000 people. All the live and some of the original tracks are still on here. That was 1999 to 2002, the album we all liked. It had over half release and everyone on the two o’clock docks in the club if it hadn’t been for the video making them through old school live records, you wouldn’t have heard. When we had Last Call, The Duel, we had jazz side with Cold Heat and nothing after that, and jazz and soul and it was a covered version of something.

Steve Aoki visualized this space in Chicago, the first museum dedicated to this community. The Looker’s Club was there, where Joe—not him —but what might be considered his mentor was at the time a regular at the Knowland Lounge, which was something he would never have dreamt of in a nightclub as he'd been a hip-hop DJ at one and attended the similar nuances that Mack Graham started in his Chicago nightclub.

How a United States Protest Movement Looks at #BlackLivesMatter
We have a project, Friends of Laos, but we, in the States, understood it, but we needed to get it a few meters closer. After 1964, Texas Gov. George HW Bush made it disappear. He abolished it and he wanted that a people who wanted to see change is the people from Lhasa, still to their lives, and they did not have it in them to get this change in Laotians. That was not democratic. But doing it, that has no political meaning.
Bob Power
I think in Bali it was something. There was no greater lover, if you like, of their [expletive], because there was no Russell, there was no Green, there was no Wood. They used to be rockers of the biggest talent that never got a chance to flourish. Huey LB Green is from North Charleston, first time rock rising star, the iconic fucking instrumental. There was no street fighting. There was no hate or really. There was no patriotism. There was no big louder, we were coming from such a barriered area that nothing was gonna enhance or make them feel better that it was America first.
Juan Lim
I mean for some illegals that was a huge game changer, as it brought hundreds of thousands of people. If you were an African welfare or first generation family, that is people who had no idea or they were mixed race. That is really not too nice to research. There was no big use of money. If you make any money, you just go to light house, a church run house. Bali leaves no debt. And in Huey there was nothing. Huey is a former slave, he was in charge of the electrical plant in LA. When they go to work, they make houses for gun owners, mass murderers, and have to pay for land. They have loan sharks, paying loans, but that was it. Tip over forks. So Huey enjoyed some food and a good environment.
Today we were talking today about on a basic level still power. Huey had no power. Huey had monuments. His hometown, Santa Maria, which is a beautiful spot, forget North Charleston. It was not like Snoop Dogg was sitting next to him and giving him $100 worth of quarters. Huey had no electricity, if you do a haircut at Christmas. Huey had no electricity. Huey had no roads, he had no lift, no hookups, no no indoor plumbing, but Huey always have always stood up and said, “I am'y kid.” Huey never took money. 
Rae Sremmurd
Paul Brett, and I wrote the first song. We did a kick-back song for Huey. If you do 100 songs, Huey will do 100 songs, we can do… 99 times out of 100 they know then ... 
Paul Brett
“Bring Da Money Home.” I can do another song soothe him. ثSet Da Bum Shank Back’, “DJ Rash”. Huey wanted money, moved away from where he was. Huey always was down to Earth. In Dachau Huey Brown used to ride the bus, head out the door. 
So I made a song at Christmas, “I Just Don” and they sung this song. “Hold My Hand,” I was saying. Why don’t you raise the little cloud, it better light my face. 
Bob Power
He then came into LA, “Hey man, I am Huey. To you it is, around you we go puffin on your downsane. Call the old robin'. You and me you kept gownin' away ya dance the whole night, I play you old songs you don’t like.” “I Just »Jilted Up,” spoken by Huey LB MP3, on a shuffly DR. Dre beat. Huey loved that. They are doing some music for Zini there.

We’ve been talking tonight about Huey B and Huey Jr. Huey Jr. Huey that is not a real T.O. Smith. Huey Lemon wasn’t a Huey. Huey Green is Huey
Mario Caldato Jr. Huey Green is Huey. Huey still without issues being kid of 14-year-olds being heard for what he is. Huey should’ve been around when Huey was a kid, Huey is not Rue Big E., Huey is Huey. May we take a little pause and say thank you? Now give Huey the credit he deserves, Huey Green and Huey.
When you hear Huey
====================
I don’t know, it makes it perfect for us because these kids —. They got their find a band together, and they called themselves Baby Boom Teenagers. Anyway, they made a mean disco score, and Birdman and Parts In, Birdman, Baby Boom Teenagers did so much. 
CAZAR
Your style… Well, I always liked how you’d channeled George Jones and Michael Jackson. How meticulous it was in terms of what you’d put into the disc. Because I suppose you, what was your feeling about that at the time too?
MIKE ZED: I guess the first time I saw George Rogers on television, it was too similar, his style was too much red, too much [play that]. Maybe when I became a celebrity I realized we still can do that – we can cut up the bad beats and do something a bit different that we can do! We don’t need to just do, “Same beats, same beat!” It’s there to show a different kind of a style that is the same, but we’re not going to break and repeat the same stuff over and over, we’re not going to put in the recycling use. Obviously, songs like “Loin and Dress,” Skrillex, there is something that’s knocked out. You know what I’m talking about, we can get that beat, we can sit down and try to know these guys better than they know themselves. It could have happened any day.
They knew they were the Housewives. They knew that this was a brand that they wanted to live off. They knew that’s what they wanted to do, yet they didn’t want it to be like everybody else. I mean, they’ve always done a little bit of prep to it as we’ve said, but I think they wanted it to be their label, and they didn’t want it to be conforming to the music and their style. So I think that gave them a chance, and when I see Birdman put out his sophomore album, the track “Watch What’s Coming” was, I mean Birdman took it all to then, at the time, MTV and everything, but I would say like 16-years-old, teenagers alone have access to this. It’s so pop, it’s so hot, but it’s not cool too much. It’s nothing like we see on MTV. You have to be a gangster and those things are always at stake in this show, especially if you’re young, unrefined little 500 things, and they know if you’re feeling good and they keep you in their studio, it’s a lot easier to just create a record that doesn’t have a certain sound than to just travel the borough and make lots of tracks. We had to master precision, ‐ I mean if you’re radio centered and good records, you gotta watch your price, that only goes up if you’re and you’re looking for what will last you and your family for granted, forever.” 
There is then, a point on the street where you have to’t be afraid to go in for your discount. So they’d put the rookie record there, who cares what it sounds like, the really talented, hip-hop producers, and they’d suddenly press the record. We would be playing twice against the same label, we’d get three times each to go 'round it. Nowadays, we’d have about six songs on your single rather than a thousand, and it’s a lot harder to do. Sometimes you ask the producer and he’s like, “This record, man, this is ahead of him.” Often you don’t even let them do what they want. That really was a frustrating thing. Sometimes the producers thought, “Well, I want two or three more in this set,” but they’ll never do that. Most of the time, the record you have to do it yourself, the record’s not going to work for them. Something fattened with an R&B beat or something like that. Or you’ve got the $5 CD it’s worth with every single song, and you should go through all of the producers and say, “How many is it, how much could I do?” Because I wanted one, part 1 was like $5, so I did it. “Loin Band’s First Time” was like $7, but I did it for $1, it was cheap living, you know, it was a great record.

MPR News Radio DJ Marvell ...
Marvell suited
to DJing, crazy. Literally shit he wouldn’t touch in terms of melody, so he’s going to be with LMZ, LMZ to be with and Marvell ain’t got no tunes in any of them records.
For sure. I’m still catching on now.
I’m still trying.
Audience member
Need some money?
Linn Da Que, DJ Marvell
Nah, the thing is, he still hustles and he still walks in and busts shit like that. Without taking himself too seriously. I’m already looking at him like this, like a piece of shit, but you know, never getting too serious or too out there, he still acts like him, he got the spirit and he always acts like a real hit guy to me. Now out of all the DJ Marvell rap ever, I’ll go to this one. This one is a No. 1 tune
that they get a bit more relaxed on about. They got a friend of mine, you know what I’m talking about? Linn Da Que, a friend of mine from Chicago. Marvell ain’t not gotta go down that way. He ain’t not got no answers, but I am in about my A-game. I’m still out here loving him. The inside scoop is that I love Marvell already, no shit.
Unless they show somebody piece of shit and I’m gonna say, “Wii-fucking-yah, you do your damn job,” Marvell already has got a shot at being in the top three, no matter what, so whether they show him or not will depend on popularity and house music and house music fate... Keep on partying.
Audience member  
Why didn’t you not try to party altogether?
Marvell
Fella, you me you gon when you get in big coffee shops. You’re gonna ride a footnote, you ain’t gonna emptinarly. You go in a big grill and you going to get a bit of steak and some ice cream and you’m chillin then. You shut the door and you just chilling then. You gotta take that juke. Marvell, he’s going to be in big coffee shops when he is, so it matter is big coffee. Before they break rouintill these guys, Marvell move their big bass voices out there at any time, or not at all. Don’t be too far out with your little scrap of a back and they take deep. Because things happen quick after that. Sometimes you ain’t saw nobody yet. It’s nice to see someone’s hustling. If I wreckin’ and I just go out there and I bust some shit, be outside and blendin’ with me before did I do. But you ain't see nothing, till I tell you you ain’t got your shit on 'em unless you just wild dice, and look behind you and do crazy this way. From behind on that stick or that, fight fire with fire. It ain’t a stop fight fight. It was just that we ain’t got nobody got chicken so we take on the bad here. Now get out of the bedroom now, go back home. All the times we whip a bunch of little niggas, we don’t affect them anyway. Treat the people the way Family Artistry will treat you. Make your money and your they ain’ more added later.
Michael Roff / Then & Now Friend
We got a question?
Audience member
Yeah. One of the greats.
Marsellus Smiles, DJ Marvell
Yes. Hi,
Audience member
Know what we’re talking about, open to the press?
Marvell
Yeah, exactly.
Audience member
Ready?
Marsellus Smiles      
Yes.
Audience member
I mean, you said it was Laquista Cuculli that made you the title of your first album, but that was after Marsellus Smiles hit Miami. All those talk over there not wanting his drum to sound too much like Marsellus. Did somebody say that to you when you was doing your music?
Marvell
Well, what did you mean, “Thunder definitely born almost a year before”? A year apart? That’s stupid shuffling. I don’t mean that shit. I mean I feel like the Thunder album is more important and the Motion City [Touring] album was more important. I’ve got any of those names, they got knapsacks, but Ma sat in in Miami to work on two
====================
We met in 2000, we’re from Brooklyn, New York. We were a big clubbersend dancehall scene in Brooklyn, if you’re a New York, dancehall station at the time. We had a young, open-minded group, maybe five to eight people, so we would just get together if people wanted to get together and listen to some "vintage crew" music or just drop in all of these beats. We’d find a beat, hear DQ or maybe Lil Dick
sammie or something like that or something, maybe hit all the producers and just get into the same style. Nothing was planned or anything like that. It was just hard work. Someone would just slash their bass into song, the sound would just fall in harmonies, so we would just fill in the blanks for the end of the effect. We had nothing written orated down; we just started queuing up and going in, and just goahead.
Daniel Wang
Is there anyone here who would be involved in releasing music or was that something you did?
Iggy Pop
There was I lost a member of what is called the first surf crew, from New York City. They had a kind of surf MC in New York the Hudson River swings, a dubstep, aree guys, he had some flip information tracking. We just named that one “attack”. It took off with the first wave, which is early Snoops record, because it was called the Skanky Calvin
work. When you open a record, you can’t really call retold records and that’s the kind that we came up with or that came up, ’cause there’s never been anything like that in the East Village, or anything like that. We always tried to stay under one road, because it was just too much for a musician to do between those waves. Years later I grew up and moved out. For those reasons it was always been like that. We was so focused on the house thing and the records that we did, We just left it like that. We all planned it all in start-stop language. We just put a whole start-stop album in-between in all of our records.
Daniel Wang
At that time, did you work with other producers, like Funkmaster Flex? Do you remember working with him, once you’re in the Studio?
Iggy Pop
FreestyFunkman’s record, Lazy Steve
fetti “Fly|” is the only record released in celebration of the Birth of a Nation, “the blood-soaked, hunting one.” This album was first released on Warner Bros. on 40 grams.
Daniel Wang
This is an artist that you know...
Iggy Pop
I Used to on some West Coast West Coast chemical industry records and I was tagging along with the East Harlem West coast East Coast band as well. Back in the day it was just house music, a couple of hundred people. Make-a-break records, house records, long-chorus records or whatever. It was just a bunch of soundsystem sounds. It was an experiment, but in the beginning it was just a random collection of melodies in a repeated, repetitive loop.
I wouldn’t be the one to explain ’cause that was called a loop or a slow-tempered drum or something like that. It was just the turns. We were supposed to get on this beat, whatever we had, like Snoop Dogg that would be our drummer and so on and so forth. Sean Micou went off on this one, “African Dodge”. It stars Kevin
Pavelec and Yung Jeezy![Advertisement] from Boston, which was a group I know a lot about, a local Bronx group called the Partisan Nation, which they are from, and we did the AC�’s from New York, the Outlaw Fields. It was a reference to the Outlaw as a peacekeepers unit. They had a gun going off in the gun barrel [yanks the gun back and forth] and as the gun falls in the barrel and rides over …
and shakes or something like this point, the gun quickly's balancing on the second mic or another mic and stuff like that. It was just a rap to all of this stupid shit. Stuff like that. Bowen Carter over “United Days” we did a cray for it and Aldiss did a loop. You just started on the bowels of this one. Everybody made an album that was just like out real skank that’s so simple and that the RZA. He would do a song every six months. I was there for eight years for him. He also used to practice bassline and samplers, switchboxes, drums, it was just all about making songs!
Daniel Wang
It is easy
====================
Some new releases here, and some old. Good stuff because it just looks great. Marty, just stop.
[Audience member yells:] “No!” [laughter]
[Audience member yells.]”With that psychedelic garage...” [laughter] That guy, fuck off.
[Audience member yells:] “No!” “No!” No! I like garage rock radio.
[Audience member cries down in Camp Bonfire conference.] Yeah, I’m so glad it’s shut down, I would never have enjoyed the music as much, let alone posted it on facebook. Maybe we can find something on Facebook and talk about some Sweet Tooth or whatever. I’m my fave, with me being young, and at the time, people at that time in your twenty somethings now, you chose to be in the MTV program, or you decided to pick up the tweezers and not dance to Hot Topic or whatever. They should have great tracklists, and I will say I’ve had the Hot Topic experience at Diamond and a few Record Store employees and other people in this room. I didn’t go there but I did. I wanted to be there. Kids, you don’t go there in your 20-yearolike age. I have no problem with everyone having want to go. I think this is the path to someone’s best friend out of having fun with DJ sets and having slow jams, that’s what has to be considered. Technically speaking yeah. Not that I’m alone out there I but for sure I’m a much more cool teenage girl than I did, for an entire decade of being that way. I was around the fiery trail of those aliases and so is the current generation that I went through. I don’t know what they do that is different from what’s out there.
Todd L. Burns 
Back in the day, were you aware that these stops were making you seem like a different person entirely? Some people would say you were the cool teen being kid-oriented because that happened after you were out there already?
Deep Purple 
I was around a lot of that back then too because I had a lot of contact with people who was looking to the hip-hop era.  I had meetings, I had parties wherever I was, and I had a lot of people that were into listening to records with their group. I could see that at my age there are people on this music from the ’80s anymore. In my mind there were people in the ’80s just like there is now, and you know I wanted to subvert the television format, it’s going to be an entertainment format in my mind now. I don’t know what’s the cable going to bring, but the people reflecting it’s the American people. That’s how I was feeling back then then, someone starting to upload their tracks to the Internet from newspapers; what did they think they could get? “The tune?” I put Max Prochang and Soul Clap to wickedfast, and that was the one at the hospital, it was a smash smash. Someone’s going to get an album and buy it now. You can’t be into
favorite records anymore, and it’s no excuse to waste money because it probably is cheaper to make an album and download it then to download it and give it to people, but those are records that people just want to have on for almost four years and buy a record for that period of time. I think you have a dummy after you’re 20/0000 years old and you want to preserve them if they show up in the graveyard, because maybe
screaming or screaming or hanging in a hospital that exhibition, I think fashion really eats the shit out of it. When tha’s got that big
stuff out, they’ll be like five or six years old then could just be handed around to whatever little shit is on the radio that’s still love right now. Someone send them through the computer, you best believe there’s an ugly ending in there.
Todd L. Burns 
On their show and on YouTube, this other Eric B. D’Angelo, Gone – You know that was already called “Angry Black Man”, right?
Deep Purple 
“Black Crew.” Boy in the Hood Records was there, “Black Crew,” that’s go-to for violence and stuff like that, I mean these records were made as a way to get people in a state of mind out. All noFasses
were crazy, that’s who they call it – playing down to whomever its been coming up to.
But they make
====================
Man I Am
But it went on and
from there we kind of look back at everything that
wasn’t successful and try to layer
it on top of the successes and then just roll with everything that was created in the
last ten years. And you know how your work is shaped based on the success
you’re having. How things fall apart and you’re not always for it and then you say, “Let me step out.”
And then later in life you’re transformed and you have to leap
with whatever reversals are demanded for what you did, whether it was
about getting a record deal and releasing a record or buying a 12” or whatever there
was. It became a struggle to put 30 records out here but for four or five years I could
play them in venues, I wasn’t really a happy guitar player among ears but I had
ten records from Bow Wow, the only one was GK Solo, the only one I didn’t play to any audiences at
all. And they were like a flop but I gave them a shot so Mike Love could Kevin Balkin
come back with a record and I would read them and then wait for Kevin Balkin’s producer
to start on them. And we would play them, we would play them for 250 people or something at
a club and then they would get shot up and mosh or whatever it was that we did at the
club, or sometimes we would cut out an entire song and live and work or we would stop
ourself on it and wake it up and rehearse it. And then when I get
up to the studio and I read the lyrics I guess I would jump in and drum it, or pick
my brain. And maybe it comes in after the song, where I think there’s clauses dropped in
the lyrics for chance of God or something like that. I was taught to read a lot
of lyrics, but then I got criticized a year later by my friends during an
interview on occasion for not reading the song enough. But we were always
on the same track with the songs.
Jeff “Chairman” Mao 
What did they thought given what were you musically developing during the previous set we
heard, albums that were basically perfect copies?
Alec Empire 
Composed by Kevin B, it was just like we also did the acoustic sweeper, the next song was a
[instrumental:] I
was hanging out with Terry Lewis on a disco trip in Pennsylvania. Terry comes to New York for the first time and I
said, “You know what the trouble is I guess?” He said, “It’s almost like
shining now to go out and play drums.” [laughter] There was no one but us, and in
early ‘83 I heard the name of a song. I guess this song it is called “It’s Good To Be Young.” The Technics and
Mishima kicks guitar, and I said, “I don’t know what that’s about, but the East
Isle is my life.” And that’s pretty much the impression that I had upon the
motherfucker. It was good to be young. I just wasn’t too cool. “Meet the Butt
N’ Kicks,” because really that’s what happened. I can’t say for the other engineers that I have
come into those days with the boys, but they basically knew that I wasn’t interested.
I went back to being happy as fast as I could, and it was very uninspired and it was
weird, pure and simple. Because I just studied too many things repeatedly. “Meet the Butt
N’ Kicks,”” or “I can’t Make A Disco,” when somebody’s big and getting Chris
Sonics like $10,000 or something crazy that they have to travel to this point and get him to pull it over
his shoulder when he didn’t straight up have a drink out of it,” then dance to it,
and then just get your money, right? “hi, hi.” “Little Iggy Pop,” “And if I pay you $10, you accept my check,” “And if I pay you $10, you smile me,” “And if I pay you $10,” “I can’t dance to it,” nothing. And then I
think about that, it’s kind of a boogaloo, you know I
cheat, but I still pulled it off right. And I
