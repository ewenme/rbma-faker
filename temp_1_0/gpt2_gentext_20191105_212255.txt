Welcome everyone to someone who looks like Rex League, who lives in a nice studio on OurMotherLandness, is from Columbia, South Central, Texas, and is currently on the road to a complicated virtual reality project here living in LA.   It’s a relatively new thing now, but I think there are projects on a lot of different sites doing it, and they’re doing it really good. They’ve got like around a thousand people working at different levels to do it, and all their cash and everything is out somewhere. Only half of it is actually being repped here because the condition of the place and the artists are just awful. So you just keep taking some more money out of the guesthouse and give them a place to just stay, and it’s so bad. What really kills it is people don’t realize there are people who are trying to help the artists get better and better homes. Who are trying to help them have decent mortgage and things like that. It’s really hard for an artist when they’re like, “Do I just stay on this diet?” I think it’s selfish, I don’t like to live the way they live. I mean, I live in LA now too, I’m 19 years old, but I live having a BMW, serve at a restaurant and rent a studio. It’s just awful – some of the stuff they do is just great, and you just don’t realize it when you do it, all of that money up front, and you think that it helps them to get somewhere else. It doesn’t help. 
Tony Hinchliffe
On the first record that I worked with Rex League, I played about four or five tracks because I’d never worked with a jungle group before, right? I didn’t know what to expect, but I felt I was working with the band here in LA.  I remember running the checklists because I have roaming beats, there was so much going on. I wasn’t exactly there to watch over everyone, there was a lot going on, but that was it. When they were doing all these radio raves, I would get into the group’s rhythm from time to time and just be outside. It was ... I think I was five-six, elect instruments. I don’t remember too much about it really - I’ve worked with electronic elements and I’m going to have to pay attention to might I might? Lots of jazz beats, we would experiment with just may percussion, etc. So, we would experiment with just different styles of percussion, and rhythmically we would experiment with different tempos and we would do that to basically recreate so many things.
Audience member
What was running the checklists the practice method?
Tony Hinchliffe
A lot of the consistency when you work with that group, I run a checklist like - I’d never worked beforehand with a production team, but I always had an electronic theme type of music. At the time I didn’t know how many beats I was looking at in the day, but I always had something. I was like, “Well I’ve got five, six tracks, and like I said don’t take your money out of there unless you’re trying to put yourself at risk to do something different.” I wasn’t trying to clone, I was trying to just create music just for me and for myself. I have this Samba Samba our mother, that I just love, and so many homeless slum artists in the workforce right now – just remember someone like Howard LaTroy, he’s 5 feet 8 by 4 feet, and he made this incredible viral video, and it looked like a star coming from deep space. For him to come from this world and just do the right stuff and be the first person to do it, I don’t know how much money he thinks
out of it. Because if you work with a mentor you learn patience and you learn how to play people in the right way, you learn how to play people in situations, because if you hear the wrong drum to do an important groove, it could fucking end it. 
[laughter]
Always looking over and watching over people, again, and so many other artists, if you work with someone who knows what they are doing, they give you a chance, and then you’ll probably do it better by spending a bunch of time outside, so you learn your lesson, you’ll be a better artist.

I just think they are good at what they do because of what you’re doing, what you are doing. When you notice new people and you train them, they do their thing, and so that then
====================
Thus fails the theme which is threatened by the Bama "Thunder", who build a bronze statue and a guitar rack- Art Council , the Crew have influenced by B.B. King he says. Congress
just happened to have this
hopefully humble working man whatever my focus, and shoot him while he's walking out with a scroll in his hand we shouldn’t droop for.
On the other hand, when you shoot at a person and you really don’t know what
to put in your eyes at that time, when you shoot them in the head, as you said, we think, “Ah, he’s
killing himself there,” but I think you’re west coast striking base for being at parade. We think of their limited shooting styles,
Had it all been different, this would, first of all sound like the cocaine offense we had back Afghanistan, probably we would have
been dead in the water. From being shot dead in a position of weakness. Someone told
us, “Look at the record that they had on the left running from the back
nest to the police cars like we’ve got to punch this dude in the fanny bag but
we get killed.” We had to face that and use that mentality when we shot “Thunder” “Thunder” was because somebody was following them, and we had to get in to ground and play. But we didn’t have guns or anything like that. We had our AK-47 and a couple other weapons, and we shot “Thunder.” All we had at that time was extreme laziness with our less-than-intelligent, the people discentered. Over the NRA, reading, “This is trained
in violence, this man has drugs,” when you drive over and Rapper demonstrates to us they have Oxycontin in them, our record player, he says, “Get real easy, man, I think the whole n---a went in and they shot the ass of
the Bama while I was in the fanny bag and they shot his head off.” 'Thunder” resonated. And we knew that it would be a great addition to our record. And, that once again this was a Brown Shirts “Thunder”, complete with the mouth of an uptown fanny.
Ed:
One of the things you mentioned about making this record is people taken by surprise at
the pistols that are shooting up right now and the ease of firing the Beretta. Even reading the thirty stories of people connected to the gangster lifestyle, when you come up with such a negative, a really bad rap in the country, in your own city; when the police shine the light on you,
can you say anything, when you’re confronted, “Two years ago, I bought a gun. I had no
time to try to defend myself. Get setting,” what a life for someone -- so to say, possibly. But I was still
up in the fights and training and only discovered the rapidity when Rapper was talking to them. They
were coming to the hood, so you can’t really suggest something so harsh as considerate with a real brother like the brothers here. Not
anything said, right? But you have a great example right there when I watched Diddy Dance do the techno
and the rap,” and his name was Mack-Dee. “The Money Daikies” was one of the most famous songs of
taping and Burning Brew was one of the greatest potentials for it when they actually played it live. And Diddy was three years younger than everyone else.” and everybody sang that song put the man, having all his friends in the building at that time, and so on and so forth. There you go, now, in 25 minutes, there were four or five or eight seconds that had a chorus say, “Eliza sings her heart
while we’re fighting,” and I knew that was the future because Tyra Banks, Shelly, they’re part Canadians. But it was really such an important moment because I hope we have it on YouTube, we’re all memories, remember the colors, you can look through there in just three seconds if you want it. But that was one of the tracks where I started fucking up the whole, “Buuuuuudgy, it’s here, it’s going to get together but yeah,” animation. Styling it up in the most dog-like manner ever through fast clicking, there’s no real emotion at all in this record. All it was about getting, “What do you do, brother?” Really no emotion at all, except, the fans loved it, and it went on and on to
====================
†Game Over Tama” is not in it or and everyone listens to the ‘Skywalker’ track over and over again they understand what it means and are touched emotionally. Then you have “Game Over Tama” and then you have the album and see what band is a band in his city where he lives, that’s it is like the album is called “Game Over Tama.” Really, there is nothing in the world that comes for that anymore. Now it is like as we play in this room it is like wow that record is played in my bar, it is just so hit-mix. I analyze it and now people understand what this is about and also people are like, “Oh, I am interested but is it an elemental mix?” Everybody own their first-record and new artists wanna make. They don’t tell you, “Look, you belong in this club, you have been invited and you are part of this genre, you have the artist, what do you do when you become an artist?” Everybody choose now, ‘What do you do?” Twenty years ago, getting invited to the club was the most amazing thing in the world.”
Todd L. Burns 
Yes. I was listening to Firestorm record and now almost everybody from DC to Fort Lauderdale turn around and leave and Sound City will play Firestorm record and you will know Firestorm record, Firestorm record Cuban music. It’s like 1980 and 80 to a room full of kids five years ago. Where is this thing festival now? I have a streaming service now and I can listen to them. So, I tend to listen to hardcore records now, mostly Foxy Balboa records and Freedom Jazz. If I only listen to National and I only hear Erasure and stuff. Even with all the radio plays these days of Machine Gun ... there are so many things that have just left in the world these radio displays with Echoplex and ... [shrugs] with Hip Hop, It’s like it’s like techno from 00 here and right there, that’s it. Everybody turn around and want to, “Who is that (bards drummer)“ “Who is that?” Just to get layers, change them after, be it LL Cool J or Matt Cuevel, or whatever, the Joni Mitchell song, … I feel like, you know what I mean, it’s in our DNA. We know the point when we are old, we know the currency is not because of today but we always want to be in their shoes.
Serkis
For now, we will move onto Roland DJ and his personal journeys.
Todd L. Burns 
Before I start talking Roland and the live, depending on what you want to talk about and where you are, well this guy Roland is not a public record don't you?
Serkis
Yes, yes. I mean, Roland may be joking, but he thinks. [audience laughs]
Todd L. Burns 
Is it possible to play to people in the room that maybe you haven’t spoken to on many occasions?
Serkis
It’s not possible, thank you.
Todd L. Burns 
Is it possible to call him the most talked about of all the jazz artists?
Serkis
Yeah, he is that talk most popular of all of them big time.
Todd L. Burns 
But I mean, as I said before, people always think of Rapunzel and they hear about Kanye and so on and so forth, now that G.O.O.O.D. Music has come into being ... It’s almost like Rapunzel is a pop icon for a whole generation. I believe Smackdown Live, which isn’t the premier Hip Hop display, likens and brings hearts to the table and sounds that will easily play over the speakers. What do you think of that? I’m having trouble with that.
[audience laughs]
Serkis 
Maybe I go in the heads, for noprops, yeah.
Todd L. Burns 
Earlier you talked a little bit about your memories of going to the Redlands and Ernesto Cortes. Do you remember them?
Serkis
Of course I remember Ernesto, but I can’t really remember the name of that specific room “Watertown” or whatever. It’s too dim and cloudy to be comfortable. This whole fluidity is not to be romantic but it’s so spectacular and colorful, and there is something about being in there and listening to live music that people miss but there are those moments that are just phenomenal. I don’t want to cry, but it has been affected by the digital and live thing

That song was posted over by comedian Taran Killam -- who wrote it for him. When I was 14, I was in Queensbridge, with a bouncer who demanded that I get my mom and my friends, my guys. They finally allowed me. I just didn’t want mamas to bring cool new drugs and people. I liked old black music. I liked music by the Ku Klux Klan. Everything. Comic books at 8:00 o’clock. I never thought I’d be here. I taught myself to read at 8:00.... I freaked out and listened to this whole world of other freedom fighters, like
Janet Jackson and Jimmy Jam and Harrison
Hughes and, it was that revolutionary. Wikipedia, what was Ray Allen talking about? Let me explain to you with Ray Allen? 
Tamika Jefferson   
Not Ray Allen, I guess, but sounds alike, but it was other performers like Brand
Bass, Donna Summers, but that combination had something important to say, and you felt something, and there was something in
that. You've got dancers, you have dancers, you have music, you have everybody. This country, it was… it covered the ordinary everyday daily human things, you just see, we were exhorting youth to not give up and not agree to do something anti-establishment, you know? We were raised by coffee and Duka-Doo and how she makes boiled eggs, and we bake a lot to give to folks that gave us love, you know? And it kind of parallels us, and we’re making records for people in no way, shape or form that we’ll feel sorry for in a second because we hate their izakaya. We trust that, whatever person they live with, we’re in the Motor City. Put them in a phone booth and love them, because it’s about faith in what they’re feeling. 
It led to the other thing that some of the different kinds of lyrics that came out, like Yanni’s “Easter Bird” lyrics and “You’re the Real Man,” which I love. So we give hope to the world by putting that homely innocence, and we give hope to each of you by giving you gifts. We’re doing a job. Every time someone calls us up, we’re saying, “Ma. My name is Tamika Jefferson, and it’s my mom’  and she’s asking if you want to come to her house. Are we on time?” We just speak to her, we just work on the microwave again. We use digital technology every now and then. I learned sitting with weighing scales before I learned going into a bathhouse. I dreamed of this. My mom wanted her children to be fine with the gifts that she had to give them. She gave them things, that she can give us to be like a household with, and I’m telling you, does it have it’s name? But worth every family in America. Malcolm X is dead.
We you know, to me, it’s a family that is tied together, and how you help them, let me take my mother. 
Tamika Jefferson   
Right. We’ve come a long way from brown kids coming in the bus because of this first step, taking the first step, it’s just like black lesbian people, but all the people that deserve to get on the futon, and everybody, you have the foundation, our momma made it possible for us to be happy and successful.
Tamika Jefferson
No more excuses, hopefully, but it doesn’t hurt at all, because you just work on the piano, if you don’t have money or money to play the piano, then just give someone else a hammer and we can stop banging on each other. I wasn’t Ruby Sparkling, I was The New York Doll. For me, my mom is my beacon. Not to mention, she’s seen enough of these causes over the years. She chooses to be alive with me on that day. Thank God, ’cause I’m not gonna “beat the hair on the back of my neck, I’m gonna give you a good meal and a good night.” But she always looked out for me, and she’s seen that “ya did in Mississippi really helped those black people,” and she was instrumental in that aspect of the fight for equality.

We’ll hear that the next record we make We’ll never get down with it but people don’t get down if that’s their first record. Because it allows you to change. Always there’s always been something to contribute with the chicken, that the go-to for us is these creativity stations. When we could be a recording artist and sound fractured you can create those. You know what they’re doing with those records. See, ’88 Italian Record label was one of the most innovative of longstanding labels. Remember how Potatoes and Flavors Records came about? You saw it in the movies and it was Italian Records. Third record today has actually Italian in it as well as we could get. It’s all very Italian once it hits the radio, if you know what I mean. Not all of it is Italian, but there is still some Italian some times.
Nami BAO 
Do you think Italian food back then was even as good as we (laughter) can make it now? It taste more like Italian cabbage soup? [laughter]

No it was more fresh, when we arrived at those, well it was like we were up to our normal teenage 12 AM self we would seek our dinner. It could be raw meat because our mother, she would make all of those noodles. These doesn’t contain any pepper but she had those but fortunately I don’t wear sunglasses I don’t use sun protection enough but now that would be better. The vegetables I use, I cut all the vegetables into three, four small pieces and then I put them on a sheet pan. They are much less messy then vegetables put in dinner plates.

How do you eat a massive meal if you have three pots on your balcony in front of you? Just because you don’t even get wine by yourself now you have to count your pantry.

We are fortunate but sometimes you need to do something just to entertain yourself. Happy hour we liked a lot. If you own a house, you know there is a lot of work to do.

If you can’t handle the amount of food and what’re your special food needs now, that’s how you warn your parents and they have to do their thing first. Learn where your hands should go.

Lali'Mario Bey<|endoftext|>Make this lane. Tul­Tak, the Miami rapper, really ones of the best music of that era. He is one of my favorites on music because he never rap while everyday was his life. You see, what made him so good, much he’s more or less a rapper; he don’t listen to Dre, barely bother with any of it, he just a more loved music, if you can connect a Roz rapping, you go to him man!” He is an even more loved music more than fast music. The biggest thing to me, how did he become so popular again, man, is because those older Detroit teams was an empty rapping team, but they could press like seven times more punches than that team, but they never said nothing when it was his time, it was so black. Like, I start the letter like 'You gon’ choose him as knocked out on the couch come watch this kid move.” I can barely read this guy business, and I have to shout like “get the Roommate”, so they can only relate. Miami is going to say “shield!” [off-mic] “You gon’ go buy' you some coffee, man.” Everybody can just see his finish and go, “that’s real Big Poppa beats!” It gave a tear for Teddy Mack [in 2004] 2016 has his face on PSAs. He is one of the most important to me. Everybody knows, if you say his name, they feel it. Cleveland and New York won’t let one little kid have some money not to get his lady card?
Rodney Hall
We used to rob like half of everybody in New York to get his bar card back. The boys that come down is really, you know, “I got 5000 on you so you gotta rob,” pay 'em off,” you know? It only got that much money or no money. And they drive their co-workers crazy back in the car when they come around. They get on the station wagon and back tomorrow to get back paid. Then I got in watch that nothing is happening, and what happened, this was no lesson, man. He heard something about Jamie Premier. I ain’t got nothing, man. That shit was astronomical for me to come inside, “You got that rap on your bike, my man, we gon’ fields this 2 over here, let’s bet.” When they ask you back a bar, they play a track and you hear “No---” and “SOFE,” “Sover’. B-B-B-Butt had a lot of confidence, he always laugh, “B-B-B-Butt,
boom! We gon’ shut up, bitch, and we conceivably here.” He thought he handled the trench warfare, “B-B-B-Butt.” Especially, some of the time I was locked down by him throughout the game. He used to just get up on his ass and get up on the couch, and halt the game. His was special.

You got me “Bring the Me Anonymous (Dirty Games in Africa)”,” Johnny Mass, it was all these hip-hop producers like Dat Bike, the Big Pun, C.B.E.J, they scared hard back then, but I
====================
Every Saturday night, thousands of people roll in as art vendors and merchants, shopping and enjoying the variety of markets that have sprung up over responsibility in the greater San Fernando Valley. Oakland seems to be an attractive destination to visit because there is a lot of culture and food that comes in from not only the west coast with the influence, but also how the rest of the world goes about eating, culture, making music, making art, whatever else you want to do, access is said to be limited in the north, with a lot of commercial businesses dominated by Downtown California. Portland in particular has a lot of influence, a lot of people coming from there, but Oakland at the moment is home to the scene, this big city, and it seems to be stable.
Alex Konop
Where did you’ve wanted to be, then?
Bonesaw
I kind of think to block it out, this is the first time where they didn’t even look at me because they were chasing me and they wanted my DNA. They wanted my DNA. They wanted to be the dead person... I never got away from this dream of coming there and earning my money, that I wanted to be the citizen. They were like, OK, well, now they want my DNA here. This whole opportunity, this is coming up around us, but nothing, very little involvement from them, and about sixths of your life, going to prison every two or three months if you get arrested. Your clothes are taken, you spend your money... The police want to steal your DNA, make it look like you’ve robbed a bank and you’re not registered or something, so now they have us. I broke. I would do DIY beer making because I remember a time where I could buy three beers on the weekends at the bars, but it wasn’t taken away from me. So I went the DIY beer making way. That was my first challenge. I wrote my first book. I aimed for 24 hours, eight days at a time every Saturday night putting on two or three hours to watch something, chat, think. Listened to things, me and others would play concerts, robo to, hang with friends, drink something, got to be prepared for the noise. I didn’t know what to expect until I got down there. It’s like Goodfellas wasn’t going to play until 48 hours, so it’s like you can’t be in the field until 4 PM or 7 PM, watching some random dude drive down instead of trying to get some seafood dinner at two o’clock, so it always started out that way.
Alex Kapadia
The second challenge it would be, knowing that you are the first one to do it, getting treated the way that people in all of the big cities are treated nowadays. There isn’t a history of this. There is a big restaurant in San Francisco who is called Chinies and they open the first just right at 4 PM. There are not many. So you have this area, there is very little here, but the people here are gonna be accepting of you. They accept the refugees, the Mexican refugees, and they accept the dogs, so you kind of know, this is the first time where... You pull together, and you hope to make in this city more acceptance than this is. There is like a lot of their stories in the book, and they have been there, and they see someone like me at the beginning of these things, but they don’t ask you about this, they just want to help be your dad and help you have a chance to be successful. Once you have kind of that prospective as not what you’re about, becomes what you bring. You’ve been through so much, and how do you adjust to be an adult now?
BONESAW
That was actually the challenge, you know? In the book, we created our own group with a name and identity, we thought the best criticism about what we drink, is like someone on television would be stupid to drink a beer that we made, because it tastes like junk food, and they would just take away... Like I said, they would throw away two or three to make it taste better. Other times it will still be salty and something is better than it, in a sense, and then you’re going to make it fresh. In a way, we create our own label for our independence, because there’s nothing for us going out there, if people are making alcohol in Oakland, it can’t be instant, nor can they relish it as a novelty. It’s incumbent upon us, within the boroughs of Berkeley and Berkeley-Silicon Valley, to contribute to the record, to make it do the job that it's supposed to do. We want to promote the Oakland record, the label say, which people in the north did

There was a time in my life before I had quite the impressive record collection. I was much, very lucky that I told him that he loved my record collection, and I said that, even if my parents had wanted me to have it, I would have kept it, because they were very early into hip-hop. If you get caught with somebody's stuff and they call the DEA and they are suggesting you are on drugs, you don't say no and you say no. You want something. They was trying to ruin my life, and if I had said no, they would have come after me, but they didn't go well for me, and I was in a very bad situation.
We went to about eight schools for about two years. Nineth-graders, tenth-graders. They don't all have to be in school, and you do music for them. Kidnapped my sister. I knew my parents, my family, because when I was kidnapped, I went to the FBI because they catch cop cars driving all across the area, one white, two blacks, in a black car, and the cops get out of, when they see my black cousin driving that driving off it, they say, “We got him off something.” They said, “We got everything in and we’ll arrest him today.” There is no justice for my mother, which I really wish that I could have, but they went where they wanted to and what they wanted to do. I get a lot of redeeming and bracing judges because I felt violated by them, sitting here with all my big music, poured my heart into my music, played for my friends, gave away this bad situation, going to jail for something that I never did, in my life, tied or robbed, I never did. That is saying something because I have nine songs on 10 different formats, that I will play for a grand total of no money, that I get paid for, and one buy the Clockwork Angels album out of the deal, it’s worth the water ­Delta Goal, my tariff on land at the time, and we do the factory garbage and bakery food. We give all our computers away, from Dairy Queen, to Whole Food, to the airport to Cash & Carry out of us touches, and things. The appeal out there of the snack food that you have is really great, and they give out so much in exchange for a plant, very little money.  
Jack Sparrow
I was an attorney, for what you may know, since I was 12, in the ‘60s. It was a big business, nobody could afford any more. That’s what I remember because everyone I was working with was let alone. I was working for $2,500, $3,000 a day. That was the real class, and I remember listening to Big Meanie’s music are getting food stamps every other day, remember? We had a lot of "freaks," nobody got full-time jobs, they only had about a half-hour job. So, my brothers would be jobbing … I was working at $2,500 a day, then having the money just wasn't enough. So, if Sergio released the film Get on the Hustle in America and someone did get paid for it, and somebody pulled $10 from cash warning, I’m wondering if I can take $10? I’m not going to do anything. My mother had done a deal with Cash… she got the money and paid the owner, so I had to say no, no, six Harlem crafts. I would ask her. I would tell her, “I heard you’d be on their location.” ”Are you telling me in the restaurant or small bar to be on the location, because I am not going to be a police officer until I get my money, “cause they’ll pay for me, no matter what, and nothing –”
[laughter]
Welcome, it’s amazing, it’s pure education. It’s gonna take an unbelievable story to get me here, but when I got there everything was paying for itself with the food stamps. I showed my African heritage, but I grew up on this farm. I brought roaches, and for the instant I bought it, and then, just put them into my self-worth, all by myself, will tell you that I still ask myself, “Do I have a chance in life, in this world?” When I started Long Ermit’s Infamous Thug Kids

When I came to Cambodia, just the United Nations famously wiped out 21 dogs in Phnom Penh, and they were trimming the last dog where I lived. Then they washed out the same pool and they bought a pool in the same neighborhood. That so far had saved over 31,000 animals from being killed, which is like bananas, first from 1947, then it was nothing. So I bought my settlement in Matsot but, you know, I walked around, I was walking dogs and I sold the dogs in my home. Then I stopped for no longer to carry the animals and help myself. Certain people just would not walk by. They were once again exacting what they wanted from the DK. This is in the Minneapolis-St. Paul.
JOHN JANE
I think part of your time in Boracay is also that you saw the Trumps and everything. I was living in Cologne, no longer see the Trumps because they have been evicted from the market to be crushed. I also can remember that three-year-old Dan, you will see him all the time, always, who was far from the sound of that sound, I saw him regularly walking by, maybe just, he didn’t have the sound his mood was in, but that was so quickly and that was to me the soundtrack. So I kept him for two years or something and from Christmas 2013 he was sitting inside a Labrador. I had met him at just around the 7:00-7:45 a.m. time, just one morning there – six, seven, eight car horns in the window and we’re sure this wasn’t a funeral and I plucked him up on the spot – he was sitting there sweating, who knew, like this little, beautiful little dog. I… I knew his name, he was on the track and my first thought was, “Oh God, this is Von.” I thought that was gonna save me, this little Black P-40 dog whoÂ s had never done anything. It never, we couldn’t take leave of this, we don’t even own it, he was ever a dog person. Then I would come home, I pine at the zoo to this day, I tell you that. I remember we were lucky because I always got several publications from the United Nations from my school and the buses came by and everyone would pick up some newspapers and stuff.
But, it was, I mean, it could have okayed clearances and everything, but I never saw any policeman and no one would drop the dog off. And maybe one day the owners say the dog looks fine but it’s always strange or something and then all of a sudden when they say it can be cleared… The police would just drop off, maybe just raid the playground, raining bullets, tear out the garbage and blow out in every direction and you couldn’t go back. And if somebody can stop your lot now you saved many thousands and thousands of animals from being murdered. You know? But the one thing about that is that this little lady sits, sweeps but she never stops sweeping. I stopped seeing her in the streets, she never slows down in the traffic. The Dominos of NarÙยs playing and she . . . She’s chicken, very low in the lung. Our Sally, she took thirty. Sheís boneless. This is a BHA dog that has never been so low in life. When they asked about his health status they said, “6, young man” because he always had nothing but tender loving images and I think when I visited, my husband and all the former ministers would break down and cry and say things about Mr. I-vo. I said, “Jealous, this is the royal black whore, so you can stay, do what you know.” “Here, me, visit.” “No, Dominos.” But learned from time to time, I saw what my daughter did under her windbreaker, clean, not cut or anything to be on the running [children]. And then I started grooming her. She is 2, 6 and in July at East Carolina University De Jesus and I had won the national gold medal in fishing, and we lived overseas in Florida for 35 days. She always had plenty of things and she could never be mistreated. And we ran home that ’00 to go, I would tell her some stories in Punggol. Then I remember the day I was killed in a blow and my husband and I and two other citizens would run home. So, once I knew what to do at home I did not realize what I would do out there in Cambodia. So, not understanding what I would do out here we had to learn from everyone else, financially. And we did a Korean tour of Korea and you didn’t need to make a deposit blah
====================
The Fader
In 1985, the Fader basically replaced the venerable British do-rag. Dubbed the 'reel-gun', it was a innovations in processing, selection and products created especially for LA at the time. The only thing recorded on FM station WXR was L.A. Prince and some Cult of the Sun tracks. Curiously, Fader subsequently dropped the old-fickery electro (see album cover, art by Juke Master, Bathory ii). Finally, in 2005, Fader began repeated and repetitive electronic expletives.  
Jeremy Gold 
This was a methodological shift in the industry. A lot of producers where working in straight rippers and a whole lot of guys in black clothing, they didn't want to either disrespect them or juke them as a way of [promoting] themselves and their products. Part of those things would be creating an aesthetic element for them to represent. It wasn't a style, it was an aesthetic characteristic. 
Keith Humphreys
But nobody had thought about, “Oh, there has to be a mainstream do-rag,” until in I think, 1977, Moist had some Warp and Neutron I ever heard, Moist had Shadowmere III and stuff. The way they looked, they looked like disco expected to have happened. 
Tom Savini
Designers didn't know anything about what came to the dancefloor: did they want them to have sex with a 13-year-old Elmer? Wouldn’t that be upsetting? That’s what people looked into, where people would look at you and say, “It can’t be fucked up,” and then they point their nose, or God forbid but it’s 18, 19 to 55. Even in the Roxy London, the Roxy scene would go for something, maybe play two tracks and make it out of choruses. So the producers, they could play something, they could have been, “Hey, what is this new piece of shit that’s obviously different to what we adopted?” “We, Chain, here, please make a record.” “Remember your boys, here, let us put some that way,” 'cause Martial Arts, here, come up on the stage and invite your rapper friends over.” ... there were more parties and more records about kinks and more fetish and so on. But -- don’t that disprove the N.W.A. record? “Wooo, what do you think, a little piece of shit?” It was a very different thing in London than you think. 
Jeremy Gold 
But nobody thought about, “This is a way.” Especially in the British DJ club, which was a recognisable sound, it was very much loved. If you’re in the UK from 8pm, believe me, when you go to there it is more people regulars than what you should think the audience should expect. It was a genre with deep roots in UK club culture. DJs would call it exotic techno. To have mediocre records is OK but if they need fake news, and if they think this South Asian, who has not heard anything at a club before this, we will ask the question, “Have you heard Best Of Me or -” “Yes, you’re stunning!” Now we know it when we get the club. 
Tom Savini
Everyone put your hands up at the end of the closing line because ... 
Claudio Hepp 
Take me anywhere, somewhere back home, can’t be wrong. Then we played it right. It was electronic stuff because the physical area could be flat, and we had the faster things, like blowing over the turbulence going through the DJ box. English DJs, of course, hate mixing this kind of stuff, because that kind of stuff just ruins everything for them. Like let’s say this is out of a minute, which it was, but you could perform in the club, except then, “Oh my god!”   
Tom Savini   
Luckily, this was the times I worked with, it was very sparse. So the clubs become a key point, you depend how you act. You think about knowing that first, so you know where you are in a room. Then you go check out what you’re in; then you go in and do your very best. Then your best if you just play the kit well, this is hard stuff, [but] provide equal options. 
Jeremy Gold   
Yeah.
Tom Savini   
It is simple in a very simple way. You want to do everything the same way, all the time, you can use all the things you need. If your samplers are capable to not over

Something That For Me* New York City DJs from Santini? on New York's top-selling line-up, doing exclusive set at New York’s premiere. I just wanted to give an honourable mention to that. We heard you asking for this from Thom Bellini, an teacher at Children’s Hospital of New York, who would be predeceased by children as his Prada photographer.
Prada Get ready for some glory. We went to the new Prada. We still are your motherfucking nephew and honky tonk man, Prada today, we brought you old Marc Jacobs. He was a great man to be sad about. That’s where you should go.
He at one point brought you Eothes… okay, Rio, Facebook... oh no, starting again. Transatlantic. Eothes, Divine Tokyo. Solar. Blessed Father Daniel Sammartino. PANGY GUPTA, Marilyn Manson, St Vincent, Prince Jr. Wow. Knucklehead Shannon, musically advanced and musically important. Debmam, emerge.
VR KAIZER
(music: Brand New Era – “Hold On, I Cry” / applause) 
The Prada brand continues to expand and multiplies with cutting-edge collaborations from local culinary heroes Debmam Gaddaffi and Halcyon Ultra Performance. They’re lucky to still be a household name. The Prada brand is just going to get bigger and better as more selling cage doors roll out. United States rapper Kalibok fits our dreams of bringing something that God hadn't given us to be a powerful people already; they don’t ever say no. They’re here, they come and they stay among us and give us the back we deserve, thank you. That’s what’s expected of a young and powerful motherfucker. “Hold On, I Cry” was the first album that spoiled them big and nothing else, thanks to that generation active at Pepsi Center for Hip-Hop in New York City. 
DIVERSIFIED MUSIC
I say that on behalf of Prada using music has always, you know, helped me get any way that I wanted in celebrating our motherfucking late father, who was like my absolute bro, someone I’ve known certainly since before I was 20. I don’t know where he was at, but I know many people are going to tell you, “Oh, my God. He’s just so big may be his friends, OK?” No? If he was listening to Duran Duran and Steve Blouse, then he might just live up to that more power.
But I realized after “Hold On, I Cry” that it very much made me feel good knowing that I was a "real Momfucker." I was getting him to dance, going to bed with him and you know, teaches me to sort all that out. It would’ve pushed me to further beyond that, to just be real. I just had a great time.
He was doing what he loved. He was never stupid or anything like that. Whatever, all the world know what he meant, another man at the table.

Yeah, alright. Please, thank you all and, I think you’re having a good time. That’s all I got on the album, my cat’s dead in the room, not no good, ladies. I’ve been bugged, I’ve hung out all my life, thank you so much. The problem was happening but I can’
====================
”We Need a Compressor” – but in a Radiohead composition, probably because in Phyllis -- one of the most rigid, line-drawing '80s and disco songs, the synthesizer was important, that was a thing I had. 
Even when Phyllis Flowers became head of ‘House Of Cards’ production contract, he was committed to ...
The other thing I have with Phyllis was with Ricardo 54 as a person they ask ... you know, Ricardo  54 was not going to ask for much money because he got really sick of that partner. Ricardo obviously wanted to make bass get more in lockstep genes than disco to get paid, he had to know that there was other, competing ways. 
We need ... Roland buys 8-track, drum machines that are different from other big three-track machines, but the value becomes more interesting because, first of all, Roland has to pay for them, so it has to be tracked, it’s a track-to-track machine, the last "dry" drum sounds good on an eight-track, so there’s a reason for it. Why would you buy it? Just do everything like disco lots. You pay the company for a record so it’s recording records build to port and you can buy a port to get half of it, you can buy a port to bring more of your music to life, so it’s just workstations selling records, so they will work, so production faster becomes quicker. It has the potential to bring your music to life. 
I don’t know if most, my classic bandmembers, if they ask for less money, if they get offered, then they’ll be big producers that set their records performances. The way it looks to me, if I get wasp get 40
percent or it’s the guest artist, if they’re wondering, “How much do we get?” So keep asking, “Why don’t we hire he Lakota producer stuff,” because we do two records ... when we do the studio where we record, one of the best record of
I think since I started, I record on [Sound System”] Porgy and Bess’
House of Cards, I don’t use hand claps, I just say, “No, you can’t put hand claps in that song.” I think it is right now, you have to react with hand claps or you’ve do the wrong song, because you end up with the wrong tracks. So that is something we should pay for in return for working - when we’re working for 50 sets to songs ... Not for one song to record, 100 songs to export on Notebooks. If we stopped, it would be too costly because I could be a million pieces and we would think this is something that we did for 1,000 years or something on my records, and add it every 100,000 dollars, so we are getting fat shots up, we’re going to lose all these songs, it would be hard, then I could stop back drilling and refining my rein. They have how chains to pull on our heads instead of being like, “What’s the clapping me up for when my record comes out?” I would bring them that bad, [laughter] “We’ll get the side of the trucks out at the end of Monday.” 
Let me clarify for people [inaudible]: we have working for 50 deagles and we get paid — even if we work 10,000 hours so we’ll sit at home and still try out, then any fool, you agree with the idea and believe in it, and hope that it works out — then you belong to the crew. When it connects with that best dream, you have to do “Big Games,” so I keep playing record after record after record with the promo, so I don’t get bored, I just keep trying record and it gets better and better. 
We have to train what the next record is going to be, you need to buy ‘Big Ice’s and send us to London... The more you know, dancing or whatever, can look at 6,000 things the other record does. In all the time I thought, 'That’s crazy, hell dude he makes ten records, he really keeps making records.” I’ve been through a lot. I’ve worked with Robin Young which is crazy. This is the Cybotron which is a special foundation for us to do our records. Rhythm pedals are important, hookery and the harpsichords. We can put them on the front of a record if it’s too much resistance. I want it, not too much

Addison Groove
We had that card and we listened to the conversation as we walked in the studio. Coming out of Revolution
Saloon, there was both rap and reggaeton, growing older and making
music and sampling operas in the process, and listening to the Miles Davis album and I was like, "I wanted to make a record with somebody talking about his beat now." And tried to listen to some of Miles Davis
album, God Knows. It was really exciting for my mother, my brother Hank and my girlfriend Julie, who always supported me and my mother who was the
concert host. We had small shows, but every year we closed our separate concert
houses. Every year they chose the same people they would choose, and adapted. We ended our
latte jackets. We were all straight, everybody was in of the ones you were ready to wear for
Saturday, and dirty, scree, flatt, humpback, and a big beat, and the people doing Saturday morning, for breakfast and lunch or tinkle, were all straight, and whistles and teeth and so much know-how and satisfaction I liked.
Then Miles said, "I want to ask you your brother, since you make this record. I think you
should do something for Miles, a concert." And this is like a
line – this was a little bit of knowledge, this was ‘98. I really, really, really didn’t know anything about so many young aspiring musicians, I was really coming from a lot of
surreal music just working with what you have at home - by not having a lot of
experience that they need to see or attain. If you know how to get found out, you can get in the industry, if you know your level, if you can get some make-up and you know what you are doing, then
you can maybe do a concert like maybe The Notre Dame Rooster, but that kind of established Symmetry, in English and any other language, as the act.
You know Miles really wanted to be on stage. And if you know how to read music, this is very important to what artists do for musicians, even when there is
hardalarm as musicians. Miles is very close, that, “Remember?” I can’t believe this guy had to
sabotage me on the phone a few times and change the phone number or something to
create this situation where they both regretting that they didn’t get on stage together.
Randy Muller 
What’s it to you, Miles? You said, “Sometimes I cry, that I have not seen Wordsworth in hands”
Tim Hecker 
What’s it to you? These guys were here, like anyone would have heard words spoken, and they
also sang along to the songs we were playing. But I guess you have some
oppressed people in this room. I read somewhere that you might admit believing certain people can exploit a situation. That you may be under the assumption they can’t go through with the exploitation. Do you think about that, does you think about it? Do you think about it? It’s not particularly good advertising, by redlining, it’s a lie, coffee houses, the hustlets did not elect to support a
businessperson with money, not to employ themselves to another level, they did not have a financial guarantee. They went, “Look or do not do what that
who owns this business did for us.”
Who’s counting? It’s someone else, and I think we understand. I don’t know what you are talking
about, but another one of your guys, he had a good job, he had a good representation, there was always someone here to help. I was kind of fortunate, because I got to meet a businessman very recently, and he was just a nice guy, and not with money. He had a good market, and surprisingly, when we were alone since the end of
Mux Media, it was Miles who was back with us, with a four and five line, white shoes and overcoat. He did fine with that, and there was always someone to serve him.

Truffles starts as a project in rehearsals, with Stevie Wonder… He records a track in the studio. I couldn't remember. He doesn't have a bank account. We play it.
Mist DOOM
How do you really balance playing it, in a festival, versus re-masters, seeing what can be done? You can do remakes, but try to keep it accessible in the same way, just the same kind of things with RZA and Audio Tape instead of musically there is RZA playing in the festival, just in the editing room.
Shazz be labels. Just lose their equipment. RZA re-masters.
Truffles
We use GarageBand, even though we were working in GarageBand, with two separate things. GarageBand could be mixing live. Just play a track. Put your hands on your pads. You don’t need pads for GarageBand specific instruments, it’s GarageBand. Put your hands on the drums if you’re going to a... If you’re going to a festival. RZA does it totally different. He says, “Now, what I want to do is I want to have Tim Da[Iques] in this vocals, and I want them to produce it.” It is really that way. His [Continuum of Good] Culture is his more art-based music. As soon as you put him for the garage band and they make the tracks, you take it what’s it doing? It’s GT Bassline, it starts playing again right crazy fast, and it’s fast-paced, and it’s a music. For less time that render if you’re working with two separate things. It’s faster, by giving the production to the more hold the director .. it’s story and feel. If you are sitting there with one of some songs and you want it to be radio-friendly in a bigger...
Paul Binder
If you ask Hip-Hop Heads - they’d like a record like the Roots… this record being released before? They’ll like it. Those are very successful. This was released today, the day after. I see that. If you have a track, play it, adapt it, and put it on to another track, and you don’t lose it. Stevie Wonder and RZA don’t do smooth sexy melodies, make them glamorous, make them pop. Just make sense out of them. Just as we call Todd Terry style smooth, he’s not in. They need to sit in the studio, because’s how they get our records. They don’t produce because no one wants to hear them. But they do work so much. It’s very similar with Serato, Hip-Hop Heads, but as time goes on, maybe when you los fast, you just want to dress it up and make it more like a disco track. It should be like that. Don’t be afraid of it.

Audience member    
Ronnie Waltman! Ronnie , my best guess is that it is a parody. It is so funny, there is geometry in it, and it is a reference to Quintardreî (I have used his names on my records for years). They called it van de Roland, because that is what you thought was “rhythm.” Your mind couldn’t label it right. All they want is to do right! The nigga will catch on it.
Audience member
It is like a trap trap, it is this stupid vibe. When you see a Cubones album and you... Before, you’re seeing Beatles records, or you see Happy Mondays, like this whole idea of ... by where is that? Colonial style and everything, but the state of Florida just has all the ingredients, what is standing between them, is the same. They can do it, they don’t need a producer. They just use whoever can do it for them. 
Paul Binder
That’s fucking cool, it’s basically an influence. It’s not like anybody off these records is Nestor, the classic is like Fat Joe, he is so infamous because of his production video. All that stuff. Cubones, The Roots, Fresh Prince have all the guys coming over. So what, we can do

Sold this week.
Liz Markus 
This is one of my favorite projects that you could possibly, live at the right place. I just finished recording “Bang Bang” and when we do the album, the last album I did was another club called the Tash, there is so much more subs mixed to make it feel like the club. Loud Future, that is pumping bass music. Their rhyme style is so unique. They are befittingly misogynist as fuck, so this particular song was conceived like that, and I was a party kid and all that kind of stuff. That is the reason with party music.
Tishia 
And once it was arranged, it was put out for us to make records.
Liz Markus 
Well, sometimes I even go to parties with my new album or my mixtape and everyone gets teary eyed and dance and moan and of course jump. I can do it all. I went to this fro heavy rap festival called Merry Fig is the hostess, she’s a 19-year-old girl. I was in relief camp with the hotel so I was like 18 and the next day it was like parties with double shaft, guys pounding karaoke and people just matched their shoes. Soon, white girls started making bukkit and BMW, all that was amazing. I was so naive. We started My Pussy Raved. Over, I don’t know how long I was there; I was like 13 or 14 years old and I was gobbledygook. I was like twelve at that time too, but the next day there was no bang bang bang anything, and this beat format of interest, 21 to get dance girls. That peaked at 20, 21, two Fifa girls and three of them did “go-go go-go-go-go-go” and they went, “Dancer” so I asked all my friends to play it. I had people all the time doing it in my lounge, and they made these six-bar bang bang bang bang boom dance songs, “Bang Bang…” I beaming down from these places, I could hear everyone calling me from everywhere at me. But looks like you just keep ones of these songs; what do we do, what do we do? I wanted to do my own music with the taste so much that no one missdash from the remix. Like, what else do you do to your own circuit if you’re 11, 12? That’s how it started then. You can do songs in your own lounge, but you can’t break it down like where you would break your beat in the club. I was like 8, 9. I was like 12, 13, 14, 16 when I started taking my hip-hop, when I was growing up, more of my shit is around now. I just wanted to make music that had a real punch to it, so I did it with beats that would keep everyones who listen for that punch going, even those who wanna rap to the juke. If they don’t think this song makes them in tune, they wanna call Big Beach and call Big “Tuna” to their rapper. That section of the song could have a crossover in me, because Big Beach is hip-hop, they just ― anybody hear “Family Matters”? Big Beach gave “Family Matters”, he called it “Family Matters, Don't jump Jump Don” and that was we call. To me if you kick your head, you make sure nobody hear it. That was his whole song, and Big Beach never knocked, so everyone just called it right, so we just kept going. Things keeps going on, you have the same ball house thing… that song really resonated with everybody, so even today, Big Beach in a beat where he is trying to study it, it’s still about feeling. But at that time, that was a father figure, so I was that type of guy and I was a black girl that I put even in the club. It reached my audience really. I think go to parties are the only place that you can live at in Malibu. You better sit at your parent’s; “Family Matters” is your kind of anthem now. Then if you go to parties, go to Bang Bang
Liz Markus 
Jingle and jingle, that song has been so hallowed, it stayed there for so long, itCame up as the anthem for going to parties in Malibu. You could have a lot of people playing.
Tishia 
That determination to make that what it is, because there is no people choice, if you are going to go to Africa, you have your sisters, your families, you have your friends, you have your friends in Malibu so you

It was not hell. It was just quietly... Actually, I was just waiting here and when I see

nostalgic 
Because certain things we find in New Orleans these days in regards to the New Orleans Saints are that...
CAITLYN ANTONIQUE
From what I learn, the Saints have hip-hop lyrics.
Taron Egerton
And kind of pride in saying, “Damn, that guy who owns this limo, Ghost Ron, he’s doing good for the Saints, sit here, I’m tired of doing all the limo jazz. Turn out Danny B, he’s a little group, I’m tired of doing all this business. I’m tired of doing these paid gigs and getting the first question,
Saturday Night Live. Turn out Danny B, he’s a little group. I play the ride in. Roy Watson, he really made a name for himself. He actually had this beat,’cause that’s how…? Anyways, Shadow Moses did this… He did one there, only problem was money started out backwards to the Saints over there.
You know who I mean, the Saints are sitting here rocking your cake, man, we don’t want no Willie [Carlson]: you can’t pay us to jive.
Paul Gaglione
That’s it, sure.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
What do we put up on this message board?
Cathélia Byrd
Release the names of Byron Bell, we don’t got with the stuff. Like Roy Watson, the Jones family, Marty Stinson, Mack Males… These were only real major producers in Houston back in the day. They didn’t get enough money, they didn’t get a chance to start projects, they just worked their free time to do records. We could listen to whatever records they had up on Red Bull or wherever they had their reels, medium and it worked. A lot of artists didn’t feel like just getting out of a paycheck and knock it off just off some radio stunt, because they’ve worked their ass off for years. Jazz and artists they could listen to, they’ll just make a record.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
We could probably have one at this weekend if you want? I’ll be on it, but where are we collecting it?
Paul Gaglione
Right.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
I want to do a Radio City Station sellout at this weekend. If we can show you. Although we’d get a video of Midnight Cowboy in action on a big dancefloor, but we could show something of the history between Band Y’re, Beyoncé and the Saints.
CAITLYN ANTONIQUE
Right. Road to the Swamp is really young, so that was cool, and I'm glad the city’s got their hands on this one, and the video’s true in getting us out of the city and that’s far.
Angela Davis 
We’ve got a Catt stop.
Taron Egerton
We got ourselves in the middle, you know what you’d like, but this record comes out and I done a taste of my mouth. I wanted to do this and I was coincidentally a local DJ, Fusion'N’DJ, who put us into the hand of Band Y’re, and that’s how happened. Queens of the Stone Age had a signature sound on the radio for years, but never had any chance to get out. We just took football while they had the cream of the crop when the season was planning to kick off. They knew who they wanted to do what, so that was as good as they ever had. “Sugarpipa Mama” was a song that was played on a lot of Atlanta stations, and Avenue Q had a huge hit on Sirius XM, and Ray and Styx were here with like, “Whee Wan, how you got to be this tall?” Your road would always get pulled over, and that was just a line from this record. We all can forget everything else we’ve seen about South. Come out here, enjoy yourself. You got nothing to lose. Tonight we’re going talk a lot with this young lady, Sandra Tutu, who’s bringing you all out. She brought us back in as House Mafia.
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
Are we there? So that was one track we can have, for sure.
CATHÉLANDA B
So it is now, why don’t we put up a Radio City Station station right now?
Paul Gaglione
Do you know what I’m saying, do you read that?
TORSTEN SCHMIDT
But we can
====================
The first installment of Passion by Third Man, released by Level Records, was something no one could have expected. They were digitally aged. I speak so much from that time, and from there we had some successful singles for A Tribe Called Quest. My [artist] has some nice Free Code™ CDs, but the sticks from my amps and anything else, New Order’s cassettes or cassettes that were designed. You [have] 2×LP ''Technicsums or 3×LP tapes or Thriller’s platinum records coming to mind. The tapes are an acknowledgement of “In Your Memory,” Jamm’s opening “Slop,” “Skinz Over Pleasure,” “Back In My Tribe,”, Jamm’s opening, “My Horde,” “Immigration.” We were releasing records for a long time, but we’re releasing albums always. They’re going to be in South Park, “Count Chone
Remix.” Every year we release an album, there were more than just “Formula,” Dave Durley and A Tribe Called Quest had, six albums a year. Together all our records were just moving the needle when it came to memory. In 1995 I released my first album, Big Sport. The project was a big commercial success, and it felt really good, because when you play an album, you couldn’t play anything but the artists. The process where when the music goes off, and you sell a music, you could go back to the artist first. I try to stay out of the business, and just respected ground. I worked on 10 BigSport records, and I have like six vinyl only records and all that else. They always act as a very special project to me. Then they took the lives of my producer and me, making our names known. When you bring a record home, you realize unfortunately that there is a caveat and you also set us apart from other records from these artists I’ve worked with. This began to feel like an innuendo to my friends and me, and my guests at John Howard Club. Are we trying to bring us in here and someone won’t tell us -- and then Bryan called us up immediately and said, “What do you want with the drumheads?” As we said and said, and continued saying and saying and was spinning vinyl, we were the big break in the house with phenomenal hip-hop music. This was more than just about the record, there was electric guitar, then some of the craziest beats for dancehall in East Stroudsburg, the best smash records that you could find in Pittsburgh since “Honey Boos.” Things like that and they knew all the mid-Atlantic Hip-hop artists, like D-Label, stuff like that. We had great records and nothing, we didn’t know what to do, but we wanted to be seen, we wanted to be respected. We wanted it to feel like popular music, Derrick May was known as “Stu McCartney,” and if you listen to The Roots’s album on Spin, “ボDale Do Ooooh.” When I say we didn’t know what to do, Dem-2, Krick Fresh, We sold, we never heard a word of them not being American, they was there and everyone would say “Dubhunter East Stroudsburg,” and that was guaranteed. Those songs came with that message that you won’t find on vinyl in this country right now, when something like your “Sunday School”-era Miami [record] comes with 60 Ronin or Eric B. Music. I heard how cool we could be for a dynamic house soundsystem and we were good soundsystem. I made it into a thing about not really sending a radio heavy house set out over the phone, because the artist normally, if the song doesn’t do that good, there are so much copies available that you just find a song with a track by the Disco Police. Jimmy Jam that DJ from Miami, Jimmy Jam, Galon, they were incredible, it was nothing like that in Pittsburgh at that time. I mean they put 20 turntables on their records, a turntable that could play five records, and there’s nothing like that - as far as Midwest turntables, you put them in people’s heads. 
Josh Groban
If I’m sitting in the right place, if I’m being WAVE, the @1030, 1040, Orchestra, and I have 300 turntables, I probably bear some comments of, “Damn, we know how this is going to go,” and I focus spending money on cutups, but it doesn’t
====================
This Easy Mixtape is an exciting one. The songs... they’re real tricks. I just put a slow jam with a lot of beats on there with no synths and just did whatever
I wanted. Change a beat, adjust it, whatever I wanted. That’s what I did. And then you’re blasting sides that are moving quickly or have high frequencies. I create a lot of stuff that I had to copy — like haircuts or little things that when I put it on I just do a rough overlay and copy it to what I want.
Case
Lack jewelry look this way, a blue background. That is how I work, I walk in front of the mirror and I just change it. I hear the key, I copy it to whatever I want. I try to capture the energy and vibes, it’s just not very subtle, this is just ahead of the game, this is where you want to be, it’s the fastest way to go. Spam when you’re on the bottom.
Marc
Of course, I copied it and deleted the parts that are not cut. It shows What Clement and Parisi can do. You got cheap clapping or the noise, we can bury those at times. I wrote down what I think they
should do next. I just tried it. They gave me that kick, then I just shake it to make it blend. Good shit, I think the 808 is a good instrument. I just mess with it as I went. I really did Joel? It’s like we here up at Shangri-Las, Shangri-Las, check this bitch Karl, I’m saying “HonaN” and I’m shaking it, too. I’m going down the line here, that’s my record right there, we walk in front of him and drums — I understand!
Vice Versa
Marc, in this record, you just mentioned that you tried it?
Marc
No, I did that period of time.” )

I was really entertained, it was something good, you know what I mean, I mean he liked it. I don’t know if he likes advertising, how can he?

[video: Jazzy Jeff sign to trace] “Nappy,” we always get the equipment but when you make a rap it is the effects effect. Music is not worth recording on if you don’t live up to the effects you want it to show. Be realistic, and do why you want, OK?

[video: Urban Wrath shows how he works]  
You just got a few reasons “Nappy” still hits these ears. Jazzy Jeff’s got all kinds of music. This is beats on piano. It’s slow, it’s not spiky like that and it has a kick,
it ain’t like Soulzi, Talib Kweli and Lil Knife. Kid Koala is on it too. It’s cool. Ahlik, fuck king, J 5, and the other guys. Hip-hop could be ten years around here in Atlanta, we could’ve still had it.

Audio, the video tape that helped this make its big
moment. This was like a decade ago. It was like 2001, the Grammys. I ain’t going to let that first week, Outkast. We got back to Backstreet Circus and the guys, we finished the album but the next cycle. This ain’t going to be like Outkast when we’re got stuff on the album. We’re not going to have it you know what I’m saying. They didn’t even make enough money. It was good, they came
====================
Let me try it. I mean, we have nothing here.
The Reverend Jeremiah Warren
What are you kidding?
Todd Burns 
Here, we have a mix.
I love the music here.
The Reverend Jeremiah Warren
That was the first time he ever
said that the record is radio, man!
Jebra
That was the first time he ever said that the record has to do with
music. At the time, it was just known as gospel music. ^Hear brother, there in the streets compared to today
record sales, this music was a huge part of what African-Americans could get into, so you could
get a bit of cash for a few CDs. It was a huge part of what that here is tell you. You can put it
together with gang strength and religion and try and make it add up. People would go to
the church and the dance hall for a couple of bucks to listen to this music to go to that
church and the crib, and then you just cover it up and go to your neighbor. Because your
piglets sometimes didn't see their pork chop till 2, and so you would just follow them till the
dinner meat was at 8 o, till there was the child in the barn. But they would try to balance the
baskets, and so on. But it was just known as gospel music, so a lot of
things could be done out here that simply we wouldn't go out here for four bucks for.
Let me try it, man.
(music: Toto – “I May Be A Child”)
So his gospel stuff, cuz he knew the children would want to see something of that?
[applause]
The Reverend Jeremiah Warren
I would say he never listened at all. It was simply a
much, much larger, a much more diverse image within the church at that time than [about today]; I mean that is exactly what he was into. Released by ... Noty Andre Schoedl in ’84, but more in 1983, more in 1984, and something else in ’85, the
Ruthin Taylor Factory is a record released in ’83, and was essentially influenced by Jamaican influences, because of MTV, or the fact that it wasn’t even
official. Madonna was the one to release the record as the Gospel Music Revue. I think Jerry have ... What was it called? The Soul Release.
We thought, “What do we do?” The children can ride it, because they can really show a lot love, so I did it and... I signed records to be single
for life. We did 20,000, 30,000 single for life. But there were also trump & Muff as part of the recordings. We were
blowing up those gob payments, and putting up the lawn signs when we had the children in — most of these
people have never seen anybody digg’ into a cowpoke. If a cowpoke has $20 or $50, that’s the family or of the home, but if they’re in San Francisco, they’ll not even look at a single price. These kids was there and got that learn, but they’re not on pads and so on. But I did it to raise awareness and give that message to the souls who, you know, listen to the rumbers, or the artists, if they would only listen to the treasury. There’s things out there, you know, that could help, this soundtrack to Steely, even!
But if a mother will look in your purse at the grocery store, and ask for 200 bucks for food, that’s really
her. If that mom’s have $200, then she could buy the food. Let her buy the food and feed her, but what a mother can get
for 400, then she’ll forget that her cat is down in a water hole and bonk for $4 a pound. A mother can totally
get in her jeans for $24, but for her son to buy food for a month, have $12.50 in her purse, and have to pick the first one out, then the second, the third one, for 80 cents. Again, so on. But I mean, on the other hand, if you have $1.50 in your pocket, that’s kinda charity. You save $8.50 up, and before you freeze the fish, you know the price, and so on, and so on, and so on. So, is it charity? You got nothing to answer for, man.

nothing there but a few bars for poor people. What was that then? A
