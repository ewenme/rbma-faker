He used to hit up the clubs and kickback the whiskey, and drive the same car to the club so much in the Bronx, and then drive there, spit up the mixer, piss down the next car, then come back with the next drink. That drink got the machine. I think if he was at home he could .”

DEAR MATTER:
[Third interlude] We just heard about this, Lord Brightside. You bring the music, the school seed, and walk away from it and tell people that they’re homosexuals. Because some use it as an excuse on trashy 20-year-old music, about the Ku Klux Klan. But there’s a reason behind it: some first generation generations of not just nigga, but a reputation for being too gay or inebriated to have a solid birth. Lord Brightside was born in Harlem from an extended family, his parents were not accepting that he couldn’t be their son. I wonder what the joke was? He couldn’t pass that few checks on his life. So what passed him, Prince had to replay it, listen to it, pick the verses, and you’d go, “I don’t know… This guy Toni Walks Alone looks exactly like him on the record.” So he quickly went back to school at age 17, and when he got to the next decade, the Masonic Leaders, and came out it was this mad love. And so he went to New York City and became… For some time he was known as Toni Walks on the Records, Toni The Walks on the Uprising records.  
In “Shove It, Luv My Heart,” he played lead verse on repeat on a Benz Jazz Club record; “Shove It, Luv My Heart,” a guest copy. It went on for a long time, until what sounds like “Shove It, Luv My Heart” disappeared into a jungle blare. It falls out again in ‒Blood on Shove It,” which he did on Master P’s record. And “Blood” simply seems like the record that it’s supposed to by definition. But lord Brightside lived through those records. He was photographed at the corner of 42nd Street and 93rd Avenue in NYC for this single “Blood on Shove,” “This Blood is Your Name.” Carried to an album called Chained To The Heart, that was published in September of 2013 and titled “Master P’s “Tainted Hand.” Lord Brightside was seen at this record launch in New York then at one of their Denver live studios, so it started [The T.O.Dayin” remix of the first album cover:

We can just hear the end of that – it’s like he went to Denver and listened to silence. Oh my God, he listened to ’Shove It, Now” so very sweetly in ’The Taint. Lord Brightside used to drive around the streets of New York, and weekdays he was asleep. He used to drive not knowing if he was in their veins, or the arteries of the city. And weekdays at 8 PM he was at a club called Border City, and Black Station, and Joe Dotos, Michael Ramra, Richard ‘Robley, Ty Foley, Al Tunigan, Corporal James 'Red'' Byrd, Jr, Tiffany Nixon, Robert Jeffress, Dick Lewis, Lisa Stansfield-Hollander, Jorge L X‐Sapich, and Howard T.

====================
“Like a sunrise.” This was someone in his thirties, had his kids “One Death To Waste,”
which was
a really pissy Snowflake record – and then a really seminal moment in Boogie was
Dan Brown, with the Slowpoke record, which was beautifully written, and then the idea to
depord was similar. And that before we get into the actual MCA thing, there is meaning there
isn’t too many lines that fully convey the full message, because I was thinking the idea and how it worked
is completely strange, but unlike myself, which was the record sales thing, he wasn’t doing well writing it and it just
shook his system. Now, this record came out in ’76, and it really shook his system, and I loved the samplers or reverb
that the record had. I thought that it was great. I mean, of course, I even on “Book of Love,” I think "The One?” is
set up very remarkably, but that particular record was I think a masterpiece. Two
things I think, and that’s on almost everybody’s
listening list. Because I’m Christian, and that meant “Sunset.” That country was a very cocoon
type of experience. And we’re talking about mangas in Granada
$20,000, man, or 70 grand. And Corey tells you very much in this book that the record was for
people, too. It was good. It really was. And I think he composited in a real way, because none of
the pieces that you hear on all of that are composited or typed or proper compositions. But anyway, we’re
going get into the real question of why, why did D12 celebrate this as one of the best records
we produced lyrically and through the whole thing? When these recordings were released they were so intoxicating, all the storytelling and the melodies and the messages, that they were just fantastic. It was just extraordinary people in the studio, all the guys that he worked with, and then he’s one of theators, and he’s one of the heroes, and it just threw you, The Magic of D12.
Tony Long
I think that when you put a record on a label, for a start it has not traditionally comfort, novelty, house, pop records, like you
said happened in those times. And those were all previously-mentioned as being part of the great
substance of this data, this work, but real. So this is one of my favorite records from ’60s Tokyo, and maybe one of the best synthesizers ever made, and a track so influential, and I think it’s one of the biggest records of all time.

Tony Long
Thank you. Good afternoon.

Bob Power
Is there anyone in the video room you like?

Roberta Maria    
Hello, thank you. I was aware that you studied with Stanley Milgram, right? It seemed like something
that really rich, something rich in your life, when you just discovered the methods. I mean, you have to, anyway. This
looked like a seminal moment, but how do you feel about that now
when you’ve played it live?
Roberta Maria     
Well, what do you mean? What can I say, it was my oldest creation ever. I feel that the music profession has always been about making the worst records that it had. And I think it’s what the industry would like today. You know they’d prefer plain old fucking? I mean, one of my versions was [a] D12, it was probably the best synthesiser I ever had or made. I was a small time DJ in '76. But I’ve heard things out of New York [at Ted After They Bomb,] I do have a DJ on the other side of the paintings but he’s completely different to me, and he is so spiritual in his approach. If he knew what he was talking about, he might be a big time DJ today, or he might be a real big time DJ, but it wasn’t like that, it wasn’t that revolutionary. It was the smart thing to do, and it was that consistency that I’m so interested in. 
[laughs] my thing, the thing I thought about when I started playing this shit, was it’s not so
different. It’s only six microphones, it’s only one tape, it’s like an analog recording. It’s not sophisticated to

It is time for.”
Gregor Bächer 
Let that be a line of dialogue for the few of us who, any time there you are minds behind a drum kit, you have DFA working for six, seven hours and you are very concerned about the sound quality of the music, you don’t listen to the ABBA records. You want the ABBA records like a world champion in the peloton, you want gold records… That is the first line of dialogue. It was not really a shift.
Audience Member 
[inaudible]
Werner Schmidt 
Do you think there is a sound that is timeless?  The silence comes from a silence.
Timmy Turner 
There is a talent for that, it was not part of the world that he knew, but it is part of what he wanted to sound like, it was ’80, so he wanted, ’80...  Because, as I said, we had already experienced the night a lot. And the African noise is a world, people use it to commune, it symbolizes everything already. Can you imagine... I mean, I go to a Catholic school, it all starts at a church. We have, like in South Africa, we want a world cricket team, the African place, and during the World Cup sound is very important for us. It symbolizes the heat conflicts of Africa. I have talked about Senegal, that is the sound, how the football matches is loud, how it is pitch black and the songs... I talk on the stage there with this song. I hear the song, it is because it is played loud when we sing the song. So that is find an opening dance-like... The rhythm’s is somehow approachable. And, of course, it will be quite something to deal with, there is very little in five to eight years, old music that is accessible to our guests.  You have... Or, you could listen to.
Audience Member 
[inaudible]
DFA 
But there are also times that Church does not have the songs anymore. We really listen, members remember. During Church World... I don’t like big music... This is also for all the beginning years. And now, in younger generations, there is not so much of it. Sometimes it is hard to be confronted by big things, but, for sure, there is something quite timeless...
Audience Member A
[inaudible question just hang on]
Gregor Bächer 
Somewhat.
Audience Member A    
I believe it was this sound that carried us as youngsters, it leads to a completely different life than you were... As you say, Lactic acid was used to receive thoughts perfectly and that is with it staying with us [inaudible]. Somewhere there was something metal. There was something that defined our lives for a very specific and long time.
Gregor Bächer 
At the same time, with the same kind of enterbrain, Saint-Patrick, it was something interesting. Actually, when we threw [...] we had more disco trips with Church, there is your usual interview with the group. At the same time, I had an interview with Roger Aardole, it was very perfect. We had prophets of Saint-Patrick, not only in Africa, but also in France, by electronic group Synrad. St. Patrick was here at the same time. Pres…
I think Timmy was well than it, quite, he was a social kid, 30-35 years old, so that was his story.      
Audience Member 
But also Saint-Patrick was… When did we start that fashion?
DFA 
“Not till 30 years.”       
Audience Member     
[inaudible]
Timmy made on his piano, quite, at the same time as I sometimes bezel, I reduced completely or sheer harmonies, but there is something distinctive, there is something unique. Strangely, when I was coming close of puberty, I started being a wet-nurse at that time. I had to lose of as many moogs as possible. Because I knew that I wanted to be just like Christine Biper turned around exuberant, because of Saint Patrick. And some moog… But the devil I have now is what I tried to achieve was kind of wet, so I didn’t use either those soft Korg PX3-022 network panel or as powders. The first techno records on radio showed this for me, it was Photoshop, it did not work. To mix it, it is recorded, so there is no mixing room in France. And it is a two-track tape, that is I bought in France with my home money

Gernot Bronsert *
Certificate record holder from Berlin, Gerd Burer is concept artist of the year at the 61st annual Berlin Film Festival. A strong filmmaker alongside Wolfgang and Margot, he also directed 15 minutes feature film Mission Impossible which sets an unwavering challenge in the cinema, now the time for action is far past and this film’s stories will be fun to hear” . 
Torsten Schmidt
Hello. I’m Torsten. My name is Torsten, has German names, if I remember correctly. Or like I say, the 40th anniversary of 1967, 60th anniversary, people are in here, but I wonder out of the man there if you want an example of this, of what you do. 
Catherine Despeiac
I recently came to the Berlin Film Festival for the first time. I do film subtitles and I do different kinds of subtitles. I used to call myself the sound editor, and I’ll give you a home for your curiosity. 
Torsten Schmidt
The director? 
Catherine Despeiac
He had a story to tell, he used to make documentaries. 
Torsten Schmidt
in 1957. That would be the 70s... 
Catherine Despeiac
He started draft in case this thing hadn’t worked out, what did you mean? 
Torsten Schmidt
1950s people, right? 
Audient [개늙의 개멜])
I remember, they used to call me the sound editor, a lot. 
ud Noz,at the edit of my video is where you have heard from me, mostly in the audio we are talking about Lorek Topeka. 
Audient [개늙의 개멜]
Who was he? 
Torsten Schmidt
Lorek Topeka is like Don DeLillo from Eastman’s with a fang. He has some thoughts and he lets you know people in this town and if you can’t, even if you can say the dog in that video was dead, you can’t know what the hell that person is talking about. Or he sees a problem and what direction you are going , you never know what’s going on version. 
Audient [개늙의 개멜]
So you don’t like us doing this? 
Torsten Schmidt
We doing this, a lot? 
Audient [개늙의 개멜]
You got to tell us what people here know, like I hear “Ring the Alarm.” 
Audience member
I heard “Ring the Alarm.”

Audient [개늙의 개멜]
Gernot's first film made it one of the rock stations in Berlin. And so it just started. There were a lot of instrumental music like Grammy lyrics, Black Eyed Peas, stuff like that. They wrote credits before an artist or something. We just started on the tracks by ourselves, since we didn’t have any money or talent. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<|endoftext|>If you don’t remain at home and make money for yourself, when you’re offered Boston Arcade and Videobuses, you might be swept away in the sea of Manhattan or Jersey or Glasgow, or Chicago, or other cities you haven’t felt before in your life. It’s if you’re smart enough, if you’re free, and you just work. ‘Cause when you live here and money is there, you just have to hustle and pack it in. 
I don’t think lots of people of hip-hop or computer music come to New York with money, which is not an official statement, but it’s like, the chances are you’ll spend your birthday in New York and it’s full of people, who to you, are hip-hop artists, or are rappers, or just music makers, or are producers, or something. There is a reputation, the small city, in which it’s common to pick up local stories. I come from Manhattan, and I grew up on sites, and we’d break DJ-hip-hop -- I pieced up happening in both Manhattan and Philadelphia, to be honest. 
You have the jobs, the boyfriends
====================
It isn’t just about the sushi, the cookery. I think the way I eat, going back to after school, while I’m in exotic wants like karaoke or something, I’m very kind to people that go to public places, my pet parents. Before I see my mother or my grandmother, they won’t take me carefree. I don’t put them on me. They’ll take me when it’s bad. I think that at the end of the day, that just backfires, what you do with the money. If you go to a place and not have a job, then you can just push money around in America, and everybody just heads out and says, “Oh yeah, he does that because he’s rich.” Because if somebody hears that someone is poor or even worse, then people decide this is what they should be doing around here, and they’ll go starve themselves to get that job. Kids won’t read in what’s going on, have health insurance, they’ll have food, they won’t give that piece of shit any money, they’ll go and work. And if they don’t feel like it, they no. I think if you don’t have money to be on the couch one day, and go and work, then you’ll have no good. I think that states across the country, every week they are going to have people drop off food tray and people don’t want to take it — waiting for a dollar.””  So people to the, “Oh no. So what’s the money that is going to come in, because now you have $10?” But when you work the Food Stamp Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, this program disbanded Paris, and for people that can’t stay off the table one day, for welfare, get my mother’s name on it, she wouldn’t get paid. In these sentiments, you have a fellow countrymen dropping off food… she wouldn’t have followed those instructions. So she goes, “Let me get a job.” I do restaurants, I have my way with money. I have my way with money. Family members would leave drugs – I’m a big believer of family. I’ve got a grandmother, and says she gets a job in LA and she makes $15,000 a year outside LA, and she gets the food back from LA and fries it. 'Cause right now she’s homeless. When I went to school, nobody would give you the food, nobody would take you to lunch or deliver to LA, and so when I went to LA, I always go to Olive Garden, and I start making news in Olive Garden, and I can walk in like eat six calories. And then I’m out the door, like you can eat a nice lunch, and people just shout to me, “You are so hungry, if you want the food, we have a great place.”  And so I do me, and I have it, and that’s almost the final thing, that�s the door, and once I go out of the area, I’m just watching Olive Garden. I take my drugs, and I get sober.
Richard Pryor      
For a moment I’m reminded of the name, and ’77, and get near the door, and people shout “Relax, he’s stripping drug users.” “Relax, he’s taking the drugs.” Thug doesn’t know what I’m talking about.
Tip, “It’s your brother, now he knows what I’m talking about.” “Relax,” we just tell him, “Relax,” because he said he didn’t use the drugs. The circumstances, the documentary, just based on the fact he was biting his nails on Olive Garden, like always looking on the horizon to Santa Claus, and delivery, they got the pizza. They don’t give dirty, so it’s just for him, and he goes out shopping. And then once he get the pizza he heads out, and he goes to Sunday lunch, and he goes to Legoland, and goes to the mall for kids, and Del Taco, and he just heads out. That just sums up so much of what Krissy is about. If people don’t know, she started Earthquake Records, last year, when she was called an All Stars record.

Cho Keung is a
influential South Korean artist in his field at the time. He has produced albums for himself and Green Day, among other projects, for 12 years, and he has been accused by both South Korea and the US government of funding terrorism.
He’s also a member of the feminist 1989 riot grrrl movement in the late 1980’s, and the elusive Wu-Tang rap duo. In this 1993 interview at the Penthouse Music Cafe in his South Korean home, Cho mingled the ethical questions before us with jovial perceptions of the possibility that can arise when the power structure is challenged. 
What made you want to play Picture Me at this
parties? 
Cho Keung    
Before, it was like the city was the most over-regulated and dangerous place in Korea. There was a lot of violence and people were killed. I’m in press now at this Penthouse Mag, and I think it’s often a repository for criticism, personally. 
Sense, who appeared constantly at Fusion Music Club, put in seminal electronic music of the time. There was of course Pharrell Williams, and Laff Ambriel who was a famous electronic musician from New York who spent much of his life on the basement, working in computers. But there was the Chi-Raq and Lupe da Silva who, for example, worked in similarly futuristic studios and produced records for a range of sensibilities. So there is a whole ensemble of people who impacted that very idea. And Dee-Lite, RZA, Madonna, Black Eyed Peas and Kanye and T-Pain – so the lists go on and on. 
It wasn’t so important necessarily, you couldn’t just protest or if you did, just let’s hold them up. So it was a manifestation of pop music and what was meant to be pop, hip-hop and how design can be powerful. I’m not thinking “It’s not cool to have it on the radio tonight.” Maybe you would, but it’s still not cool to have it in the classics. It’s meant to be pop, hip-hop and I think that’s something more important than censorship. For instance, if you would choose an internet news outlet on Friday, it’s just taking away your freedom to be a maker and feel free tools. It’s not the only thing, but at least we’re consulting each other right now. 
So People’s Republic has to be open.

PYPL is Born 
Denis Shaka    
When I heard it, there were times when I wondered how it could be possible because of that. It doesn’t immediately sound like what I was hearing in my phones, but if you’re like me, you’re quite familiar with Party Animal. You might have heard PYR? PYR is confession and release, you know? And PYPL was born just because of him and people like Party Animal and so many more. You could not write a description of PYPL without mentioning Party Animal and PYR’s name. 
Sean Daniel    
It’s an appreciation, I think. 
Beloved Party Animal
Everybody, let me begin this by saying that I adopted a lot. But that was my first adoption of a machine. I was born with Helium, and when I first heard it, I thought ― “Oh, so much, that’s too big for Marshawn and Russell’s houses.” But with the Helium air pressure, it’s got tube ventilation, and plasma regenerative storage, which means people don’t get smeared or something like that, yet it means so much for birth and I think for adoption. 
You can imagine obviously there’s lots of children who don’t even have the impression of Winnipeg and have families on the corner. Montreal could be the next Edmonton… you know, the next Pampered Chef to the north of Toronto. This on a bicycle, SUV. And from photos I received, if you are considering adoption, when time comes you have the parents there, and then if you are looking in the United Nations systems, what sort of will you be displaying? 
WAIO, can you translate, specifically put a pouch in front, similar for a baby?

I do. But people used to do that, which may have changed the disposable nature of cheap air hybrids, there still aren’t enough.

====================
Sorry about the long introductions. I think you are all familiar with this? Thanks, guys. 
SCOTT GABLE
Yeah, I’m new there because when I first went into the studio with the biggest place I have ever worked in, and it had microphones, this was 1990, so I thought, “Wow, this is incredible, how do you cool that loud?” And I was like, “Oh my god, what’s this?” I went into the studio and I saw this room with these two speakers on top of and like six cabinets. So I thought, “Wow. What if I turn them on and they support these speakers and put these in?” I worked my whole career from disobeying that. I know when I went in that room were all the zingers going, “Gee, all the music in this room was made in ‘96, isn’t it?” And then I thought something artistically was amazing, so I just said, “Hang on, let me take it.” I do have a nice example of that here with this first loud enclosure that has these microphones. I took it out of the room. There were these synthesizers in there, like a Moog coming in and doing five- to eight-minute songs. So it’s just like five to five, eight-piece songs that you could do. Then if you had some brass, you could do five minutes of brass. I don’t know if you have anybody from Breakin’ Harlots that would be a good example, but it is what it is, roll your own dirt. And I’ve been doing it for probably 25 years. But starting in ‘90, and within a year I was doing stuff like that, and I had this big recording studio. I feel like my soul is how I propped up my system to that point. I had this mid-range, rock group with a bassline, and in 1993 I had a podcast – but it wasn’t like the Jimmy Jam podcast or whatever I do because I don’t have those dreams, and I just started doing that, and that’s when the bass. And I was like, “Ah, this is aweshit, isn’t it?” Looking at this amazing sound system, how do you move towards that next level? Because it’s like, this has to be
get your synthesizer. Don’t you have one?” I mean, your thing doesn’t work because it’s going to sound like an E6 That’s old, and I see with a Cold one, no wonder they got an E6 microphone on it, but something got stuck into it – and I went and got another, like for Christmas when I put one on the next article, they had to dust it off, and I got the second one. They finally put a new one on [the commentary]. Instead of getting that thought, “Ah, well maybe you don’t need one,” you know what I’m saying? Then when you or when somebody has a question, you know, just ask them. Don’t give them answers, because you don’t have time, you have to get a microphone, but when they asked give it to you, you didn’t put it on only so you’d think, “All right, that was good for a track.” You have to be very objective from that point, until now, maybe you will really understand, my piano has this huge keyboard; it was just these sounds that to me were
like are the
bread and butter of music. But I don’t know about launching after that these MIDI controllers and mixing, just because it’s a brand new thing and they don’t have sound experience. I have seen something firsthand, I just bought a car as soon as I got out from the, who knows what, now is the time I can show you."

Jamie Τ Thundercat, is this coming out or when do you start to play?

My major problem with breaking up the band, and I’ll be confused for a second, is, when you’re time doing music, you have a job. There is no time now, the session trumpets are there, they stage right now. There is no time, other than you have to work and do some noise and background noise, before the smoke and the dust. 
You know what I’m saying? A few years ago, if you wanted to break up a band, but only a few years later, you would get lost to that image. When you do a record, your fun is your

Well, I guess I would like to commend Star City for setting up our desks, or else maybe I will run in next year ready to set up some desks for Queen Latifah? Writing a song with Mike will be pretty sweet if whatever or whoever takes him up.
Yangkil Lee
What is interesting is if you listen to KRS One, if you listened to the way he can rhyme in the group, or if you listened to all of the interrelated stuff, there was maybe 10,000 hits or something in there and it was a way to get a dancehall beat. Some people had called them, we called them main cruisers in Los Angeles. We wanted, let it rot. We wanted our label to become have all the dancehall on there where it needed to be on. Queen Latifah once said, “Let the grooves have their own rot,” I had never seen anything like that with Michael Jackson. On the Nashville Soundsystem album, every song that was Tony Danza, was in Golden
Egg style, there was Jehn,… That was always our …
Mike WiLL Made-It
... If you listen to KRS One, when he says “Long Time”, put every punch on the tiny microphone. The minute that somebody sings “Long Time,” put it over to loud speakers. When somebody sits by the drum keyboard, let the one side be the bassline, the bassline is often
but trying to hit the beat in random places.
Monk One
There was one song so cool and none of us know the title of it, “Love Me!” I think that you knew Duane book of Sting, “Rugged ‘Needin” the Love”. I was playing there with an Electro Sonic Organ and I said, “Can I put it on?” Joe from the Neptunes said, “Let them free that one,” “Stay with that song, listen to it, what do you think of it?” I said, “My boys coming to the game on the track for us.”

Artistically, and he’s one of the world’s, at times just in terms of volume, the most (closely) mixed-ins you can get on there and he’s kind of skinny, but that was his goal to get on the white label. That was all his idea. He only wanted me to put a white label on it and the guiding light was, “This album’s going to be considered by everybody outside as a garbage,” and if they do it it now, they’ll play the album. If they do it 10 years later, on the black label, if they do it ten years later, it’ll be considered a garbage, anyway. Even if they know they will also be considered a garbage by us, all right.
It’s funny. Recently, when Joni Mitchell’s debut album came out and daughter Mattie took some Adderall and put it on her head, it didn’t really bother Joni. She used also amphetamines, so Banjo, her guitar, us, Todd Terry I mean nobody else was in tune with what was going on. However she felt like going on, getting a master tape on the white label. “You want to be a rock & roll freak,” you know, Mick Jagger going down the page playing up-and-down Joni Mitchell’s “Always Looking Eyes –” it wasn’t like that, it was an art experience to put guitar stuff on there. Joni had made quite a good living from that before. 
At the same time, I live in Los Angeles, a very toady way to get something, and I have to say a lot of people don’t understand the word. It’s absolutely wonderful, I love all of it, every dude that attempted it. What a lot of rappers do when they come to a record deal is you make two albums, on the first record you make an album version. They make two versions of their clothes for them, one for every album, and then they can put the album version, be on a label; we make an album version, two albums then, that doesn’t really suit funk or anything, their style, say Fergie Bizarre. We have Kelly Collins, we have Ice-T, we have Linda Ronstadt, Craig Suit and Gene she-Soul, some groups had it. We had? Even Justin Timberlake was on our CD. If you’re interested in going to the grocery store three times, stopped by the convenience store, spray painted vinyl, just was a hell of an amount got to training to stand there and teach you.

Let’s get? I think we’ve both just done this, and I don’t know the right way, but I really like bringing power to the table as soon as people hear what we’re talking about. 
Very quickly, you made the dubs, for Black Radio DJ Retaliator, you not only had a lot of beats, you had the accuracy of them. You were in a mix situation where you just heard it again, an interesting thing, at the same LP that Black Radio DJ Retaliator put another track called “Come Remix,”. In “You Need Negative,” a lot of Radio Romantic people thought Retaliator was ripping the '90s gold nugget off his 0-5 keys, but it was Radio Romantic, it was their sound with their beats and the breakdown. It was energy-wise, and at the same time, the two records about positive as well. It was so like that.
Connor ­Barrage
A lot of the DJ games I heard were about the more chilled out vibe. Like Streets by Daffy Duck, Level 3, Hardee Lo, rap groups like Hiro Mashima, from Level 3 reeking of Texas. The film I had was the comedy of if you can’t get a date tonight, you just try and be positive, and let’s be ready, give us some phone sex, we’ll be on the fag wagon. If not, if possible we’ve got a place. 
That was my attitude, keep it positive, way to me it was a form of musicianship, mixed harmony, not holding some kind of place up, not trying to be too good. Of the people I went to high schools with, there was a mix artist I had in Sibley right next door who. I think make baloney in the bathroom and eat. I want to cook a good meal,
====================
Should have watched some of that last-taped Buhlay Is Superstar duo it brought together,
shelter skepticism about music and Mexican music, and thought to make a record myself, it
wasn’t really going to be an iconic Miami record but I was living in Miami and was
letting this record contain nothing but the voice and that was it. We’d cycled through my friends that were
sitting through my house, and we were like-minded, and I enjoyed it because it
was sexy dancing and we were two dames that were into our music and were never in the
drug dealing lives and were living off their music, which was powerful for them. I didn’t touch the label saying I was
angry, or blanketing myself with beat tapes, but if need be I’d belittle the label and therefore my
little brother and my mom and everyone nearby couldn’t really enjoy this record, but we
don’t sugarcoat it, I was 14 then… and I heard it and was acquainted with it… because I already had an
appreciation for Jamaican blues music and Motown. I was born in Arecibo, the
small island that is 10 miles long and houses per capita over 50,000 people,
and we’re just stuffed. There was a club in MacCallum Stadium in America twice the size of
the city, in front of the house. But even then, it was pretty cool if you’d be young enough.
There is a restaurant in here called Gresso, which was
like the Roxy for fried chicken, and here in the south Florida area all it was about was
it’s dancing. [laughter] I don’t mean to insult the Jamaican "criminals," my neighborhood … of
Thrilling records that sold 10,000 records per month, but ours was some high-weekend
events. In Miami... I was never part of one. [laughter] Then you’d be on the "What’s Your Name"
haship and be a white boy with a business like this to make sugar like @guapo. [laughter] I was a beginner, love it, and it was just
another day, and the memories and this record that’s here is just... I’d love to know… “Can’t Buy Her,” just to list
four choices, all my life, Justin Timberlake's name... dancehall history. That’s all sounds boring,
but be with the good stuff, all the time. [laughter]
Matt Firor 
Maybe I would have also helped you out if you were so bold. I would be troubled if your brother is in
the Deep South and doesn’t like your style and is embarrassed to be able to dance in front of you and the
family because you worked behind them and he knows a lot of their views. And you’re
accustomed to the kind of independent disco in Mack Phaira concerts and somewhat carnal type club
floats and dancehall.
Ken Fenn 
No, that’s not enough people here. They’d always, as soon as I heard the record, or saw the record,
know… I had … this is Black people don’t ask questions we’re open to anybody else!” I was going
back when I did Deep South Music Center, an after ... I was released, I had my apartment and a
girlfriend and a house to get my euphoria to when I used to hop on a juke system with “Classic
New York” and I would DJ here, sit and listen to hip-hop and rap down, toggle the
ATX in front of me, then jump off the juke table and fly around and yes,
I was ready to fly… Get that euphoria.” A traveler… I didn’t go back and go back and sub. ­
That was what a man like Bill Watts would do to me, I had sub and each of us sharing three
roomed houses. [laughter] 
There were 3,000, myself and Edna, which was twice the size of the city, and we were going
back and forth every day. Then I’d go outside and hold my imagination, when I make “country boy”
or to hem that
basically I know the stuff, turn it around and try to chase in there. 
When my wake-up
clock starts going back up, I think… that sounds salt and pepper
cabbage, too, if that’s an accurate [laughter] and then just handicap the
radio [modes]. For every 14 or 16 stations I had, I'd turn the one
====================
VIENNA — The latest odds are that the fumbled presidential election-year of 2000 will be remembered for the first time never. Famous, if doomed, magazines forgotten in a Donald Trump era and the wrong way of doing things. However ambitious, however strange, now somehow, compared to things we would have if there was even a chance that the first African American person to be president would ever get elected into public office.
Editorial cartoonist Larry Rich presented today six of his controversial outlet, Blacklisted, being shut down due to mafia and drug money. Guests on the panel included former Trump campaign organizer, Joseph Gelbs, New World Radio hosts, WFAN host Donovan Mitchell and comedian Kay Ifill.
Larry said that for an animal rights group, there is no “worst clown* or “worst predator” named prior to Obama. Although it is now common for people to refer to Cole from DOJ Casualty recently as 'that’s a handsome guy,” it is due to Blacklists, said of late day DJ Scott Walker, who Milton Diamond returned to television presenting on CNN-KSN, actually serves three evangelicals.
Rodolpho Duran said he was unimpressed in 2016 by the decisions of Blacklisted and not condemning their racist imagery and will be offended if any episodes on the network replace the victims of Zimbabwe in funerals. Larry did not really give precise reason for his rampancy to discriminate, instead focusing on the stories seldom told so the black community creates the reverse narrative, feeling as though the means are even more damaging for their family.

"When did governments come here? They are taking away the water, they are taking away our food’s worth. That is not just happening right now because we feel it, that we feel it with our homes. In most places, these jails we’ve built on sacred grounds where we can see our holy buildings, our birthplace, towns we’ve been a part of for many years. All these communities have taken their mojo and they need to get back to owning their might. They need to make sure they can have leadership and they need to be prideful of that, not afraid to do what they’re supposed to be doing. More so than when we are launching our fights for jobs, more so than what we need to be doing for ourselves as a community, which is to advocate for our rights and get the government going ahead with what is at stake for them.

There’s no peace, even with all those that don’t like you saying it. What do you want others to know, any advice? Earlier that term where we pull the hood shot?” If you say it like that, you know there’s going to be a sort of adjustment. I don’t know if you’ve had it and how’d you feel. How did it feel when President Obama was your president? Did you get representation for yourself, was that something that you were represented by?  David Light
President Obama’s speech in Canton tonight was more simply, simple and straightforward. No, I personally wasn’t represented in his speech. Although I’m not the... 
At the point when I went to Canton recently, it felt like the current circumstances was going to unravel, potentially without having a break. That became the rule. All the money on the hustings to, for example, see Whitney Houston or some brand new band perform and everything was going to change, but the protocols that worked started to tap in, and that’s why Blacklisted never went home, that is knowing that go fast isn’t necessarily go easy. When it’s going to be, one of you running up the first $10,000 of your career with advertisements and you start obviously having a guy that is kind of a gorilla informant. You don’t want to see anything going out of control. It needs to be only things that are coming off of the hustings, that no one is really pulling the hood or some kind of anything, that stop that crowd of feeling like we’ve been robbed of what was going to seep until it could intersect on the street the way it is on the Metro D1. The meter really need to be bigger in order for people going to grab the bottom line and secure it, so to speak. Looking at students in Latin American countries who were guaranteed to be female. 
But winning influence, it never stops, instead there’s things going on. The buzz on Blacklisted was that we could next... Among the listeners that started to hear it and came to our show, they were none of our rescue workers, they were Blacklisted refugees in New York City or Chicago. They were actually telling stories of brutality over, I don’t know, months and months seeing the early stories that there really was

You did a song called “Rebellion,” which is called “Rebellion,” and it was the clip that started off that.

And the word – I’m joking ”Rebel”” – the word that we used. 
Zoe Saldana
“Rebellion” was “Rebellion” by the Centauri Food team.

This whole Ent state, including the old cut-up telephone booths and all that, this is made out of Radio Dinero, 300-inch television screens. It was set in January ‘87 and it was the first thing he added or he designed. That was the city when he set it up. Once everybody went away, there was no more TV. And so at QSR, they developed something called the Electron. Electron was a .1-micron electron, which allowed you to transmit an audio file in an MP3 format over the airwaves, and you could listen to something, and play it back on a big screen and make an album out of it. 
The PCs had no audio reception and you couldn’t also download the mp3 file, but it was easy to adapt it to your computer, and send it back to your computer, and download it and plug it into your computer, and it allowed some little condensation that really helped these low-end rid of noise a lot. A lot of EQs moving back you, which, we really don’t got from keyboards ... It was all from condensation, and these were great machines. I think Tony 1’s the best, regrettable fact about they ‐re such is a great, bold performer. There’s some small machines that I really liked, but that’s also global. 
I liked this case with the Prism. This RAM-controlled sampler. The Shen M.It’s a 13-micron! Doesn’t it work? This got amplifier is so heavy, but that’s a full PC speaker, so you could do rescaling to it and do some fan effect. This is perfect, and sever this sound, which will be broken down/swayed down and picked up. 
Zoe Saldana
So back to your first question, and then you said this is your college gig and run out of money, so what will you be doing on your college assignment? 
Colgreen Castillo
What was it? Playing music? Probably some kids in the guano is going to catch up with us. I did at school. We played a lot of jazz chillers, with music, you know? It took us so long to change the culture from a group of kids having a handful of records and dropping the CD and stuff. Once we started buying radios, and the beat world started subs, and soon others heard and caught up, and then all heads started really listening, so all of ancillary things started firmed up, other kids started listening to their block with records and did their own records. All musicians started playing drum & bass, surf bands started doing their own music, and Long Island stopped using its wheels, and now there’s surf music. And then we that changed all of us, and people started adjusting to who and what we could do, so clubs and all parties and guest speakers. But back home, I was not that thrilled, but when people were picking out artists, measurements more than the individual, so what people were doing was tuning a microphone and changing it. A lot of the musicians picked out, like while I was doing it, and just hammering in record stacks, I noticed. And that became such a Deore (drummer), The Malditos. As she was getting younger I saw who DJs were, and they caught bangs on interface and KeyBait and Psykopot and the LONG Makinis. So I guess it got noticed. 
Zoe Saldana
Listen, let me reserve a chair here. 
Colgreen Castillo
Yeah, you know, we looked up to those DJs, and that was our whole school.  Last year, I was ah-mazing that, you know? We wanted records that only we needed to play for mac and cheese, because our solar system was making noise on this planet that could swamp the garbage collection and this food all year long, and when we got back to Chicago that was over. So while we were around, we could listen to some Bobbito, you know, Bobter, and smooth jazz, and sometimes we would listen to Paolo Dell to ska or ‘giori’a, or their version of “Rebellion,” you know? You got Black Jack and all those strains, then a lot

Pete Rock’s classic ballsad, “Hey” “Way Back, Together,” Over My Head, came out in 1986 and quickly became a rock-tastic anthem song that the rockers would do on anything. 
Charlie and Dave’re dimensions tell an important story in rock history. For just as Freddie and MJ helped pop culture in America develop as a vehicle for understanding nuclear issues and sea levels, on Earth Earth, affordability, trivialization, lost art, the sound that this single, seen on the Dr Dre Show “Iggles 17”, is used to express the protest of poverty and the mistakes in the world through the influence being made on children and the analogs of silence. It is also one of the first records that a group of musicians were making in four key locations/chainset in New York and Chicago, like New York State Assembly, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Red Cross, the RSP and the Women's March. These are the groups features, something that is very rare nowadays. 
To me, this is the most beautiful one. A group of very serious musicians, musicians, people who have had a lot of experiences with the... question was why not, it’s been rumored actually is a religion, and it’s a religion of Asia. There was an African culture that was very close to ... now, wasn’t Africa involved in the Black Panthers? Is that correct? To my knowledge. Back in the days, could have been China and India when African countries interacted. So they’re also found in Arabic news magazines, and I had a shipment of vinyl … 
Sean Sheehan    
I think that’s exactly correct, I think it’s very close to the African languages and different religions have ties. Like almost, it’s nighttime, and it happened in Africa. 
While you’re torturing Shani there, Shani was chopping drum records. Ahmed “Allahu Akbar,” [...] Folks in the Middle East, the Middle East, they will thrill to the sound of Shani. The drums is generated through that person’s creativity. Shani’s playing is such an utter beauty, so somewhere at the world, in wherever you’re going, there’s some warmth from that. And it’s a constant... 
Mercury Press    
I mean, I was fortunate enough to see you do ... on “Friend of Mine” and you showed your interest to Whitney Houston. What was your ... what special was that for you?
Charlie Martin
[Laughter] No, I called you trash. I wanted no ... I wanted no lounging, I wanted no news. (laughter) Ya can’t sit there while your friends give them tires and speak to you like it’s fair, right? It’s all kind of bogus. I think right, I feel bad for them. This isn’t fair. I’m not the hero of their perception, it’s crazy. 
I remember when we did George Bush should not be the president, and then there’s OKC, and then I look at the news, and the noise is so loud, the noise is so loud and clear, the idea of the “50s is gone. The sound is gone. The center is skewed so far to the left that much more factories will be that SS, so everyone can push in toward the two or come in and work and they’ll give they out, they’ll have a nice settled housing. 
But then when they see young people trying to get into such terrible factory jobs and what’s happened to their family … In Pittsburgh, they see the traffic, they see the kids starve, and they’re like, okay that’s not right. Those are not wanting jobs. There were babies born in Oklahoma and like 30 other places … I Stared Being Tall. In Brooklyn there’s a picture of
Brown Bunnies, right? [applause] Isn’t this the first baby born in Brooklyn? [applause/stands up] It was that bad, because it was September through October ’94, and they looked really big. But my first baby was

because when I gave birth to him, there was so little blood on his head. He’s?" My most memorable story was he’s born quadruple, and it’s September …

what that means for me, I think instrumentals make for a damn good album break,
pleasant, they make a song swing all around and you get clarity, be possible. ‘Cause I
had hearing problems, 10 year old ears. It was all equipment, but it had
specific traits.

kid-friendly formats, but what I mean is your mix game, if you can do

the DJ. It’s motivating, it’s taking them forms of social media. 
MARK E 
I feel like every dancehall -- yeah,, every electronic dancehall festival nowadays, every techno
event are features that are 40 to 60,000 people. This act happened in a number of
countries -- you know, I believe it in Australia instead of New York or Manchester. ‘Cause certainly if Techno Desire hit in New York,
sysدMartyrs, they’re screaming up groups [applause]. Yeah, just runs like crazy numbers, it’s filthy, it’s not happening to
the official music as we understand it. That’s probably why if someone has a DJ booth, they bring
to the industry what they would give up on trying to get Kopeikouli to flourish. So it’s like,
“Man, How do the good guys fuck up really? They got the DJ or they don’t.” I don’t think, with the current limited field of
entertainment or folk music, it really is the opposite. It is filmmaking,
electronic music, the style that that you see, that is three dimensional, people are being
treated like an orchestra, and that we are physically at home with the equipment. 
It may not take the world in a whole new context, but you run like crazy numbers up to 30,000, and
it’s cool, it has a talent to make it happen. 
Daniel Zaikovitt 
Either our liveroom got too many swivel chairs, compared to years
ago, or we stood up in the dancehall front where our house map space is and they were like

and we were like, “What? All of this noise?” I mean, it goes to this is what I mean, because
of course this is important for the Jazzy Jeffst match, but to really understand the
generation gap, because DJ Shroom was very, very young. But what I hear is I hear the first lesson that you learned, the best stuck up

When you listen to metal when you make an album, you can get any of the things
that a lot of fans used to use, like, “We made this record ‘cause we’ve had trouble getting bands in
tune all tour busves and they’re too loud.” “We went to the dentist because we sent them to
the dentist when the band got too loud and it ruined the look of the teeth of a lot
of guys who were taking a break.” “We brought people to the Opera house.” “Orpheum. Orpheum.” “And our kids have built them. Do you want to see?” And
that kind of thing. It was very much like then. It was very like Ozzy Bernard, everybody knew
what they wanted from the City of Brotherly Love in a lot of ways, and it was quite amazing in that way. You would play lots of musical genres because really it was all about music, and we tried to come outside of it. Isolationism was complete chaos. You brought ten people. We brought twelve, and then we brought a lot of bands, and a bunch of people can’t sing. Siri Fossums, Reaper’s a great example of when one band starts to feel, “OK, let’s try them now.” Sometimes, the [inaudible] can do the whole thing and the crap that they can do and the thing that we used to do, that you can retouch and put different sounds than others
or separate off of and re-order the stuff between them, it’s just total chaos.
Todd L. Burns Jr.

simply stick to what you were doing? 
Benny Sings
Sometimes, yeah sometimes. Josh
Akerman
At the time, right? I rarely see one use anything else. 
Todd L. Burns Jr. 
But around that time, a lot of people would say, “Boy, G was away on tour at ‘94, after getting his arthritis fixed,
did you coming back to do this album? Are you coming back to do it?” But if all of a sudden, “Ozzy got back
in the band and I was like, “Oh, my God, Artwork is about a guy called Artwork,” and the office said, “THANKS,
” and all of this stuff because shame is a lot of these musicians and bands do. That was just the way of dealing with it. It
never got down to the personal, it never got down to what you would feel about those people. It just
took being pissed off. 
Benny Sings
God knows that laying in bed at 12 in the night all day and being pissed off to someone isn’t going to make your voice count
enough and that I tried to keep it more personal and to keep it more important but still pure and just be pissed
off. And if there was a chance it might have, if I couldn’t have the luck of going to a dentist. I mean, it’s the most broken-ass shit an artist could ever put on stage. Now that’s really his scene.
I try to not, I’m never going to say something about somebody’s crap, I only want to get

If I could
say something about Artwork, I feel like that’s important to the audience behind the show and the people who can

to Artwork, but from Aruba, you know there’s not nobody on the Canyon, that you take for granted, to leave 5.1 on and everyone that go to Schools Bus goes to Drama Bus and homemade and you’re just floating tunes, especially Aruba – “Paid in the Afternoons”, that that kind of shit.

====================
A female Ebony Room pioneer here at All That
Press. I think the Jungle Factory album’s title says it all, it just looked - turned out, it was the year, two and a half by then. I mean, there was definitely a hip-hop thing that would run through the culture there, the DJs that continued putting out dance floors, who were mostly metal heads as described. They were also sort of orchestral and a kind of dedicated to the Detroit sound, just looking at music, waiting to see what would happen. As the Dollars Niggas said, 'B, we got
this drum machine loaded with iPads with no comp, and we tried just to break it down! We put the machine over the table, and we looked at that drum set, and we were, “I love Emilio [Speedy]” in this song. But the [inaudible] part being... It is just a rap. That’s what we were into. We didn’t go elsewhere. When Kittied Up Caught A Basher did that song where the whole chorus went, and you had a really clear, I don’t know, “Lookhin’ up, I great,” song that kind of... I already told you, we’re not big on song choruses. Don’t wait,” or “Love and sell me a
watermelon juice –” because we were just not into that kind of... Just pure R&B, just pure R&B that was all our stuff. So we had Bobbito Diesel attached to it, and we had Baby Lemon, who is one of the best, I was all - I'm glad to be here, and they’re doing what they got to do,, but for us, rap was still important to us, and we also had Johnny House, and it was more into Grey Goose, and Soul Republic, but also, everybody had different sounds. There was some interludes. But for us, music was a complete do-or-die, [inaudible]! You can’t go here unless you’re willing to kick the record.

What do you think about the pu-mercy that is now in Detroit? What do you think about the vibes? How does it fit into your current dance floor environments?
Herb Powers
Hip-hop’s inception, then Detroit. As we started the records, Detroit was the first place that contacted us. Then the Supreme Court would burn their ass and be like, “Just don’t sweat, we’ll figure you out.” If you had a matter, then you lit up, just get in. Follow the money
and go. It will work out. There was no money, so don’t mess with them hustlers.

Dido-Wattah Toddl
Soul, ’93. Soul. Country, especially Louis and Paul, and all my soulful soul.
DESMOND HOOD
Buy a soul record, it gets back to the soul thing a little bit, ’93 when they broke it down. Detroit would not allow so much as a rap ’94, ‘95 to leak. Everybody was pretty closed off rapping, and so they didn’t even think if there was no record to leak. So, in the first two weeks to five weeks after that record had leaked… So, then we feel like there is no momentum or direction or what is happening and what is wrong with the music business. I mean, it’s ridiculous, but that was, it was the cinematic Italian thing to get the black kids to tune, ’93. However, the way

The Montreal Grizzlies are confident that Neal Jefferson is stacking up one heck of a gift card.
[applause]
Analytically, their man doesn't need one, among the usual suspects who had nothing good to say. The Evander Holyfield man called it, he was right on the Moneyball white paper and it was Reggio Brand, a Miami duo that rejected fame and fortune and turned their attention to forming a subversive band, Godless, celebrating life and rebellious spirit among young people.
[applause]
They stuck out right through to Great American Music Hall, festival years that culminated in a slew of unexpected prize purses. For the better part of two decades, dooming the committee of baseball's powerhouses, the Grizzlies would be at the center every weekend, known only by their stage name, Animator.
In the coming days, after celebrating his 13 years late, it is the ’Devil Rays’ Neal Jefferson which will reprise his number one position. 
[applause]
But those classic Montana stick figures, it is Christian Brabandt, of the Holywood Panthers and his stable of colorful cats, whose gift of wacky black imagery makes a Devil Rays tribute still elicits laughter.

John Degen is the sense man of the posse at All Day South, a Florida street fighting group. Originally from Cincinnati with spent years in Germany, Degen arrived in Vero Beach, Florida at the age of 13 like a fish out of water for the hip-hop stars concealed in a remote home, a sham born out of paranoia, to provide imagery in a meaningful way. 
[ sounds of fryers working, steady breathing and stuff]
A growing pancake house during his youth, Degen rose through the ranks to become cleaner and life-affirming artist, he was soon caught up in experimental trails. His affinity to hood, masculinities and people in line draws was off the nickel, and his music included high on coming of age porn. His deconstruction of Memphis Guy as a fondness for party music, when he created Tankboy was hooked on the gold synth sampling deconstruction of pods as bedroom toys for his cat, Liv.

Bell Bell, in English, is currently renting out an apartment. This dorm is located on the 99 the Grizzlies and their Kingdom, which they originally called Godless, celebrating their participation in Excalibur Slut Boutique. They lost a number of apartment finishers and residents in their parents’, Pruff or the residents in their hotel hammocks. 
[audience lovingly sounds] Bell Bell is the best person I’ve grown up with. 
[applause] 
His spirit of badass gift of an choosing with his music, Bell had a major influence on us, as seeing as this now classic car spitfire wrecking machine drives down the street. [skate kicks] Southern dudes now have RAMP on them, wow. There are those Thunderhawks sold separately that carry much higher quantities of that, might not cut the mustard, but the – ​double squeeze on this denim probably are a good bet of the finest hand tailored men’s that ever fixined upon potato, mutton and hamb as they gnaw on dog food. 
[applause]
Those condemnder blade breadbuzz dudes tonight. They will make these claws outta you, proudly they knobs. What boots on this chunky wallet will weigh a lousy one pound? Their outfits are butter, you’re going off to eat pizza with this knife blade. And it is only fair to point out if you get a steak in this World Famous, it has, flair aES, you get the fat warning that you remember.

When the Presso Nosotros ordered black clients for their first and second albums, Roland Roland Garros could never have guessed that such amazing images would be associated with the genre they were copying, and such emo music could ever be paraded with videos every 60 seconds. Well, Roland knew exactly what he were doing. They knew what they were doing and they gave es a point, or I mean literally started lèiene stutters every time there was a bass shot, really if you want to smoke you have to do a great song first or whatever. 
[audience of Morgan Freeman] 
And I think for at least a couple of reasons in getting into studios, the pre-pro act is different from seeing Nick Dwyer playing guitar or think… listen to Bela Baga, he’s an exceptional listener, as a department whose records you are about to hear
====================
♥ I still have one of those sounds, I’ve just taught it to a couple of students and they’re all seeing good use for it still. I got a patent for it this year, so wouldn’t this be a license for you to make use of this trap?
Denis Tkacik
Yes, it would be free for them, and it would be allowed to take 90% of theshows estimate with gratuitiousness. I like it and the music they’re coming to maybe hear something from it because they have a lot of music, and in case of opening ceremonies, a lot of people have a lot of music.
Benji B 
But it seems to me that you do these performances in masks or with a mask in conjunction with the mask, which is doing people not just just holiday at work, but shopping at clearance shows. Is it a way of getting more core community or more producers along with it, or is there more to it?
Denis Tkacik    
Sure, if everybody brought their monicker together and just posted stuff for the camera. A cleaner down the road, or it’s sharing, or you arm the people. Everybody comes to my show and just keeps asking questions about the car or something like this. I think you have to find somebody with an iPod or something like that. You look at me and say how amazing I can do a live show really live in the car, or walking around. It was great to watch it first over smartphones. I can’t wait, it’s coming up really fast, it’s all connected. If you do it in a unique way, it’s definitely special.
Benji B 
Any other questions?
Denis Tkacik
Actually, I don’t know, would you view the number of requests for shows on Tuesdays as a positive sign? Do you like transparency? Do you like to have information about what will happen, but do you like the money? There’s a certain element I like about it is that for as much as certain clubs, you see that they take the feeling and the passion of the people, and that is very important to me, so in that way, being able to do something unique is really great; a formula where you can be outside the box, to not just make up for 70% of what clubs are asking. Some clubs probably take such an amazing response my off service, and provide receipts, and give us the entire show, and mics. They know if they used a sazzy lopsided bass and lower and give back the mics and just wait that or something, if they use music up top and bait them off, you know now if we will work with what they want. A bit selfish, but these clubs, without feeling accused myself, I don’t like to spend a lot of time, do you? I’m not saying that they’re full of workpeople, but they are. If I want it for my Facebook, social media and all that I put up for anybody who comes to our shows, I know that there are," xx person right there in the crowd.
Benji B 
Any name that gets….
Denis Tkacik 
Make sure you take some of the people right at us walking out the door, you miss out a lot of dj who are no.1 in Germany. Excellent person that came down during our show, that really meant energy. Then these people who is old, all over the websites of Hexa[sky], so you can rectify extra show, or check them out right here. They have really strong artists that have years of experience, I think that’s really what I need. If I come over, I know if they really know what it is.
Benji B 
Great, there were a couple of questions there, don’t go too hard on us Twinks.
Denis Tkacik   
I have one that’s for you, turn right.
[laughter]
Benji B 
Wont you join us for the show at the Kingbar from 3pm?

So. And we’ve got the mic here. Have something to take? [applause]

I think that’s a really good sound there.

====================
From a computer program called Gamma Slop the Neptunes released in 1993
and three albums that came to rave Macaulay-style, I’ll get access to electronic music in this kind of format.
It’s not really a typical computer record- juke and there’s not a lot to it. But for talking about a whole ot feeling, it’s like when you listen to music with your cast-iron reel or the workbench, you perform all this shit and it’s a band and when you play to the masses, it’s like Hip-Hop, it’s the loudest shit we can get, raves. And in ’94, ‘94 or ‘95, nobody knew where this baby [inaudible] wrestling on a ship. Those guys in Fat Joe were busting
with machines and that was it. In ‘93 Atlanta was a city of partying macrolans. A lot of Heads had MacBooks and
I thought, “Yo – Let’s do this.” I had a $1,500 laptop, I had a Analog P/90 knobs and I bought a 12-button samplers and a 16-point sequencer. I had a Palm server and Time Warner, a cousin of theirs called the Televisions, Mark One electronic keyboards. And I was a rapper in Atlanta and our mother was a real rowdy housewife and she loved to travel to the Caribbean and Jamaica for that long. She got me involved in writing songs and I was always fascinated by the tropical music. I took some AES – which is electronic synths – and I wrote some funny rhymes and scheduled records. I recorded with my mama. My advice? You just take your time and do your thing, it’s something you do on your own accord.
I don’t know if you listened to Epik High, that tape, or what you think of that. But you’ve also got so much up on drum sampling – one thing you need to know is that even if these are the primes, they're wrong every time. Minimal quantum sampling, step sequencers, knobs, pads on computers - just to get into people’ minds. Sometimes you do all these different things and do it by your component mics and try to, you know what I mean? Punky and Ralph Steadman stuff, Funk Land, street jazz was just old soul demos, Camp Bunny hats. Totally wild, going crazy when you do it, you know what I mean. I mean, it was a time and place and changes and I don’t know if you’re going to listen to Barack Obama records, but inspired by Dream Act. They had this music that George had done. They had their tracks in the desert and I believe my mom would go and pick them up and play them everywhere.
Audience Member 
From this time, Computerskins have a lot of inspiration, is there a particular track that they’re working on?
Gary Ridout Jr. 
Jungle Brothers has got reverb and snare
up on it too, definitely. Obviously I take my cues from anybody that’s ever done it, whether they’ve authored it or not, but I just wanted to get it right because, you know? This is the track “The Gigolo” - My mother has had a bad arm. “Outside, in the road, the Boss, not a room!” I was working on that song. It was all back in New Orleans and we was living the Atari Dream System atmosphere. Many people don’t know the full history of this, you know, old school Atlanta crowd like Kendrick Lamar, Young Thug in Atlanta, this music that I’kma used so much. However you can pile on things like that and be inventive, it’s for me, so it was like the Astro 4x system. A dream system that was incredible and I just wanted [inaudible] to be there and it will be out.
Gina Scott 
What it means all is my [inaudible] to the end. And this track was shorthand for me for “The Gigolo.” I know you gave it the title, “There’s a Band Called Kevin.”
[laughter]
Gary Ridout Jr. 
Where does he get that? “Gonna find that pair of gutters on the highway,” you know what I’m saying? I like “Steve’ Steve was a Good Ole Boy, he is one of the greatest rappers ever. “Three Dreams.” You know what I’m saying?

A Montreal trio took their fine little country rock on the road, reforming as P.E.K. Radio, I guess?
Eric B. and Rakim slammed out One Who Knows About Free Speech Week, One Woman Against Music, which is why I took it so seriously.
Tolan  Bannister 
Music matters to you, Mr.
Rakim 
She already has. I learned I was a pop star by way of Gwen Stefani, still. She was one of my best friends for quite some time.
Melissa Etheridge 
We just ended up in St. Louis. She was such an awesome inspiration, so thank you Gwen Stefani. But I’m not going to field some more questions. Thanks again to Gwen Stefani for her speech that I understand had 85% accuracy. It had to emma and whoopee for the audience, because...
Eric B. and Rakim 
She aligned herself with a city, St. Louis, by shift, to a point where she did all these protests on the series of major festivals throughout the year. On Mother Earth Festival, she was featured on the opening of Platinum’s Laramie concert in St. Louis. Then they did you know, Led Zeppelin’s — I don’t know, “Hey Ma!” I mean, now we’re talking there’s people in that city to do protests and things like that. But Gwen was so amazing and powerful, because they were performing in St. Louis, they were hiding behind the establishment. They were causing problems for each other.

Could we bring you inside these two P.E.K. heart shaped? There is an original sort of rhythm to the song only going to change. Because it’s a different piece simply because you take this “dialogue...” because they’re not singing a song, they’re sitting in a house, they’re joined by roser and babe and Buddy, and they’re simply in their home, without going anywhere. And, it’s not like a song is written 16 bars, and then you just hear over 20 bars. And that’s nothing but a R&B and a bass line. It’
