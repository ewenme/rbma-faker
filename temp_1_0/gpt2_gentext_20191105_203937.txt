Tragedy struck while making back pendent,
a far reaching, vitally important instrumental that we
accepted into our heart, but the– gore thank you out
to all the musicians out there, American producers who got us to crashing to
decorament. We get her voicing. Her piano shred got open; the
second piano that booginality he made before she mellowed it up and trashed it. Glory,
that’s what she does. Anybody there knows Priscilla 55? Okay. So, a drop, we’ll play her drop right
after it is sung. Her drop afterward is pan heavy while her voice gets
stony. Bring her into brass, move off the saxophone and bring her into the brass. She
at the end ambles off to Lavender, Lavender.
So we play her drop right after it, we try to bring her into using her slide beat, to bring them
together as quickly as possible. A drop is like an opposite hand. Go not into
minimalism, but find out where you can find the time. And using your keyboard, at
that time you invest a lot of effort into what takes you to that drop. That happens in a drop
after the sound starts to sound, so even though they’re very different within shifts
of time, you go into a drop where you feel, “Oh, my god, I wish I could hit that one more hard.” If you
don’t, it gets … there’s a reason why it’s called the drop. When you
like that sound in a drop, you try to get that sound going faster. So we talk
three or four or five games out of this one drop. If you take a drop that a change your whole sound at that
time, if you’re bringing a different voice, it may feel pretty different, but
there’s a new smell. More hesitant, outside-of-h or out of it sound, you have another
and let’s say, “The guy hit that three ball.” If we have
twenty drops, we also get
a lobby after, because we can have live bass, three basses, all different sounds, we have the
bossa nova like long fingers and of course we have a bank of microphones up here, recording
real time so the sound can be heard up here. I do some
signicables or I do a very big sound like we✩ll have Bob Drass signing a $100 bill. “Whogotandaatthat” ship has gone on for years.
And you have to know yourself. The mark of a good life, you hung out with the right people the right information. Don’t
pay people loads of money to bring you a coach. For instance, Madonna. You absolutely have to pay the organisers all you got. If I’m being honest with you, when you do something, and you bring it over, let them understand. They’ll understand and they’ll accept their mistake and they will appreciate what
you bring to the table, so it’s what you gave them. If someone has a problem with a sound, immediately
modify it. I do a lot of this myself. Gold reminds me a lot of why I put out original records. I try to go over; I focus on each song for six months trying to do it the way I want to do it. A lot of the time being out of that world, only bring what really every song wants, because it’s so fast. We’ve done this movie Gold, so you can just get a rhythm. We go over pretty fast and things happen. Go over real quick like this.
This is like watching a film over propaganda. It’s like you have to listen to every time
around the city before you see the '70s.

Yo, I think it’s probably about about time for us to go to the Yogi Berra museum.
Benji B  
Yes, please, Japan has done a top notch job with the museum in terms of a lot of
things you can see, where we can display Alden the mural that they have back here, and I’m sure
people have seen that in the movies, but none of these images really speak to me and I want to see
them
just in their rawness, maybe years and bikes and looginally of course. To me… a lot of these photographs are of
setting up, when Yogi would do the union show all the
documentaries. But I think this is about fold – and why we fold our social
carers in
because we see it more as our own cares getting after this or

====================
When independent music labels started being quite successful, they set up studios where artists would tour and then be on a plane and designed a set of equipment capable of streaming, downloading and recording website. So that today, dozens of independent labels have the capacity to support thousands of artists. And there is no single agency of the past and it’s all about promotion and the whole process that independent labels has. 
Jeff “Chairman” Mao  
Even though the level of resources is not necessarily any higher now the streams are going much higher than they were ten years ago. What do you think ultimately is going to lead to it becoming more of a popular and our biggest export will also be LA?
Audience Member   
I think we get that, but what's happening is, that in five years we’re going to become a smaller industry where studios will only have enough top-of-the-line spending to deal with risk that is about small budgets. Then you have labels and projects just starting. There’s always this reason why there’s several independent locally based DJ scene going on in the same area. I mean, like just yesterday we had 4K music on the outlet PION. It’s entering a where people won’t be reading tons on the internet to have to know about it. They won’t be getting any information from any site over the internet. Like today, there’d be Instagram posts saying, “This sample is from a park scene.” What’s going to happen is like, if someone takes a sample and there’s one kind of a sample and in multiple syllables stuff, they can publish it. And so expensive labels are much more willing to pay for that sample. For me, it’s $120 an hour so that’s a lot. And if you have ~$250 – $400 an hour with double licensing – it’s a big chunk of money and I understand why we’ve fractured. Maybe you can get clients, especially in the industry where it’s becoming increasingly important for every little thing to pass you through this system because no matter how much money you think you can be on the label, things will always be in danger. I mean right now we have sometimes six months depending. But this is slowing things down and then releasing some really good, big names as independent DJ sets with a pretty decent budget. But the industry will be more independent at that point yeah and maybe that’s what is going to happen. That FREE online streaming kind of thing, there’s going to be more of the DJ sets going down higher than ever before. And then we know it will get bigger and get more complex – there’s complicated LPs and there’s getting more complex releases. For me, these is real, or I’d like to work in Tomorrowland as a demo and if possible, it’s five CDs and it’s mostly instrumental or something. And possibly some of it is stuff with the time stamp that are a bit different or some of this might be more direct and just let a film being shot, being applied to the Roland TG-1200.    
Boardman Jr.       
And this technology changes as well as grown up there. You know, the Peel and the Boehner: That was 25 years ago, everybody if you use a speakerphone to it you hear that one. Now everybody whispers. I don’t know if you guys know, but what we are dealing with now is that there’s too much noise on the internet particularly. People will use the familiar within five minutes, eight, ten, maybe more. And so we use the familiar then as well, which is born with this technology you can get a pattern or a commandpoint to do the controls, relations, those signals people use in that music industry. We’re just talking about there we said, “This is your signal.” So moving back a bit, you know, music is manufactured and by that mode of production these labels are being fed a lot over the years to exercise power and profit to prevent others from doing that as well. And I think that’s limiting the creativity and capability of small companies that are trying to do as well. We want to take them but at the same time secure our own funding and our time and place in the Indian culture. So we can thrive and do good things for ourselves. Keith Burke

And the into the dark future. That is the thing that I have been looking for ages for the moral to figure with this. This is when Marc Antony was... The Black Friday was a massacre. When Zimmerman let him murder my partner on the street and then got out of his car unharmed with his friends. How can we collectively and collectively figure out how to address in a way moral elements like violence in that? I think we have all this information coming out, information we might be able to digest. But when the community, let alone the actor, is on the other side, we forgot that kind of advice. It feels weird. I understand that science fiction, that Steve Spielberg film, I mean, we were three or four and your kids might have read it. It’s got you in tears in on the radio or you see a play. But it’s not thought of like everybody has heard, it made us treat violence more as sick stuff. 
I know people criticising it as a good thing maybe, but I think if we are not willing to acknowledge that, it will drive people to drugs or something else, not like, “Well, no worry, what are you going to get out of this?” We are demographic and lost happenings of love and sex wrong. I don’t know, the success of music very closely affects those manufactures. This is the tape… everyone has heard this term, and we know that this tape is an input/output system. That idea is that music is a signal. A signal that you sort of can’t stop. It’s so powerful. It’s on the page and you can talk to your kid, you can talk to your family, you can work with them, you can work with your coffee, you can work with your tea, you can help them. It’s an input. It’s the character of music. You can, what is good, in writing creative code, but what is wrong about it? You know what I mean. 
I think our continuing search for wisdom, whether we agree or disagree, is in our nature whenever we make music. We may come up with what we want as individuals. In most communities, we think this is the answer. I think, anecdotally, it’s in other communities at different times, where science fiction cinema’s really potent things come from a place of fear, being a person in the wrong place at the right time. 
But beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the way the wrong cameras don’t get work. I got less compassion than I do out of this culture of violence. In the Twin Cities, the police are the most good people you ever met. They don’t start shooting people when your friends are high. I will always support Minnesota children all over this hemisphere, but this right can be taken away from me, in the right way, on specialized wondering on things like ballet. You some folks can’t even see straight, but it’s your imagination as the artist and your business model that keeps you fresh. 
Nonetheless, this is from a place of love, that love. I’ll still call myself a fan and say, “I know you had everything you wanted,” or “How many dance songs?” But when you never see the whole picture, you are just not a trippy artist, you know what I mean? This is not a negative thing, this is who you are, after all that, and that is what I intend to put in my music. I mean, in New York, this one song at times can sell 200 or 500 copies here in LA. Whatever that I’ve got in my heart will just give me the ultimate joy. I don’t know where I’ll get the money for knowing what my end game is, but I’ll be open to anything. I have full confidence in what we do because I know it’s coming but I sure, that if you’ve got you, you just do it. That is your deal, if you’ve got all my heart, I know you’ll do it.
I think I just mentioned, there is a rare level of honesty on the radio either now or probably further back in my Matt Prindle. Donald Trump, it’s an absolute light. In the dog days of radio, you were

Oh my god. Neither of us have a home use. 
I have my studios, my studio. You can apply to them. Weapons production unemployment. I leave it budgety on my side because one of your commercials a few years back said something interesting. I go up and say, “Narco is killing me up here or anything like that.” I never thought I would turn into a killing machine. Just want to stay sober at all times, working with rap people getting drugs and alcohol changing their minds. It just spiralled out. That cannot last. If they don’t think I can end it I can change myself up here. I don’t want this to happen to anyone because that you will just keep old. 
Facy. It’s just sad. It’s sad. I can pay the bills on this island. I mean, I want it to be a budget world, you gotta think that way with your money too. Especially with the digital arena. This shit-ass business, I mean, it’s hopeless, and that's what I’m telling you… These rappers, they had all this money, they could make $10,000 a day, they could buy cheesecake in the shape of a uppercut, or get up there in the studio, ask for sandwiches, $0.99 for the hot dog, they could buy breakfast. You step in the tent. I’d like to be able to run this thing like I did so many years ago. Fine, made a nice hit record. I mean, I can do music, but give and take. I mean, it’s not demeaning. Do what I live by, and go back. Use tools and doing what I do and what I do is much different than all this money. Millions of dollars. It’s sad when you put lots of money in a house. I don’t want to renounce my poverty. No, we gotta get judged. Some honky punks, we gotta go buy some food. We got our kids out there helping us, also we have the holy of holies here… Oh man, God bless…

Robin Thicke 
It was just beautiful. [Audience members listening to Thicke gets up] See what the fuck you’re talking about. This was the gig for every joint that year, $4,000. Thicke had gaudy rap stylist and desired rapper Vino D. Finally, he got that big mixtape. “Queen” was unheard of. My friends were over here bossing me. It was always Harley Cam now. They keep busting me. So I finally found my music and finally somebody busts me. I came in a couple times doing donuts, trails and shit. I was on my in-cab. When I got my speech back, I didn’t come in that little talk box. D-Gun, Vino had him Dr. Dre, it was Prodigy-like but he had his chopper, Drake, Kendrick Lamar on Dr. Dre. That’s when the freestyle started coming here… “Yeah, he got some bruv music.” “Damn, he got B-Real.” “Oh yeah yeah, he got former Prodigy.” Zoe Buggi, Robbie Hensley, those are some names that didn’t know what to do, because they’re production-based type crews. My job, they never knew what to make of it.    
No man didn’t know where that was coming from. Then maybe you’d be mad at me. But I’d be mad at them eventually, wack nigga. With my great mixtape it was all on the album, so Flaca couldn’t fawk himself on the album. Lonnie took me aside once, he was hooked on his little advice man, like telling me, “Man this music's a classic, man.” He got the techniques on it and his system like a record by itself. “Come on man, just put your name in the song.” They would work on that damn beat. Mine wasn’t from Vino D. My mixtapeography was like I guess, I was just getting for a song. I was making records based off that beats …   
No. Put down my name in one.

Episode 8 - Matt Talk
I spent a long time on the radio Kaskade – that nightmare show, ft. Kaskade and his dad. Because he was a really German magnet, he finally found his way back home, born to my great grandson and the first one.
Miracles happen, you just gotta take it. And this is another life and the last one of them as a musical artist, there’s still something nice about Kaskade.
Audience Member    
I know a lot of people out there are going to think that I just talk about “classic” European garage. It’s a subcategory of the techno thing. Well, OK, gear shops don’t usually move in that direction anymore. So, to do what I do, I don’t have to be the first one and go in that direction in bringing back knowing you know what.. I’m not gonna change. I’m gonna move forward and make my point and not necessarily follow the wave of that day, but I leave you. Obviously, I’m a producer, I beat people up, with drum sets and stuff doesn’t change; I’m blessed to be born in the same area as Kaskade is. I’m fortunate to be raised up from a family that had that proclivity for old country house instruments as well, which got played only a few times, I wind up with a wealth of knowledge of it.
Anybody whose voted into the house music circuit, they can learn so much more about it because people from Germany were discovering it over 50 years ago - Detroit, snares and just a few of your neighborhood beaters that didn’t give a black man anything more than two bongos and a lack. I could probably maybe compare myself to all of that, meets what people need to know about what they listen to. Everyone, you’re playing a mind-blowing vinyl, you’re on a great Berlin set, there’s so many kinds of bands, there’s so much in it. Take bad beats over it, slap a beat over that. Do that again, add another side and with 10 or 15 to 12 tracks and they could all be on the radio right now on Kaskdezy’s German radio.

Built with Maccings, just on the old honks, smh, always had a cohesive song. You just starting from this classic that I heard going to a lot of Detroit everywhere, it’s hardcore, not grungy. It’s like that, it’s coming to house, makes me thankful knowing I have this record I can play in all of these Detroit videos or I can sell it to customers and — I think the question I want to ask anyone out there, is does everyone just want the big hardfork or what? We’ll have a backlash, so if everyone… people from Detroit, in particular, they want the big themes, they want the voice pups, they want the girls in those clothes and they want the women in the chains and they want the farthest thing to fuck technology ever. There’s a whole generation of young men in Chicago and Detroit that are looking to it right now when can we get a game?

I want to get more into it because I think banger beats has come a way of us just adding an edge to our music ever since we started to hear your voice in the places we listened to your music, talking about something around the time. But do you think, maybe, when you’re getting on your regular radio call, you could suddenly have an act of a cumbrer record with the end of the average song that’s traditionally considered going for a black crowd, and maybe DJs, or hip-hop DJs or people in these venues, who react differently depending on your art or your music, that might go huge when people hear
====================
I chose to work in an area close to the show area because we had been playing there each year since 1980. This year we played on Saturday at the Pine and the Tobacadéros Fair. At that time I was playing violins and I was not used to playing concert of the proper technique. This was because the work studio was not developed of the e-mike, where the violinist was lying with the strings, a little trill and a slot, when the instrument sits in the centre of the coffee table. Depending how you decorate, different arrangements may be the best or there be better numbers. If I can’t play with the strings but I can have nice arrangement of numbers, then I am good scoring and my scores are very not accurate without the company! When the works of Bach (Who was the person who created Bach in the SS Decfs?) started to play…everyone wanted to try something new, and when we felt good typing it, they tried to do something fast. For the track, clockwise, to me that is my style! This is what I want to have, rather than what Marvin Gaye decided to try to do: white accordion on white band and stop. No lighting effects. Don’t have confusion to cause more jumping, vibrations or more emphasis on the notes. We played brilliantly, and that’s what I want to have … that’s it for me. It was sexual?
Todd L. Burns 
So and do you like the Sugarhill…?
Gerd Janson 
That was in Elvis Presley, yes as a Christian rock musician, otherwise known as Faulkner, we have a very artistic person in us. There is a man associated with the spotlight by us as well in a restaurant fine service packed restaurant, through dj Tejas. I want to have that full ambience, biscuit bread, talk, butter tenders/recipes … for 30 min. So I forget how many chickens there are in this restaurant. But enough to have sour cream with that to donut. Talk as wearing chocolate sauce elements
Christian Nobel 
I imagine you can do that at work or something, your style is better than whatever was hosted here recently, however long you were…
Gerd Janson 
This was Kelly’s lament, believe me she was crying. They came in with the pizza for me. Why wouldn’t I eat pizza at any restaurant, wait,” or even more, going for three days, back Sundays. This is because for me, don’t no coffee, nothing. I don’t like my nose bleeding profusely, I don’t want coffee. In that sense, this is my trio, everything ’s better after 20 minutes! Give me an aloe o serving glass up off in my head with my chopsticks.
So here they were, eating coffee Serbian, small tins of Almond pizza, small tins of Almond nugget, which is two and three quarters grams. To any vegani, take three teocas, drink in a glass and it is all the same.
Todd L. Burns 
So there are many things you could have on your plate than just the pastry. Drink beer, savour once, once in a while soca, you want to taste something really good, even if you put it away?
Gerd Janson 
By going out, I want you want this pays and when you photograph the restaurant house you can put nothing by. I can sit there and try it all, just don’t press anything.  That is my little play on it, just try what you want, but in the end, if you like what you smell and they don’t have too much sense on the packaging and fashion of rendering of the first video that we showed plenty of Americans, we can play Disney and Walt Disney, commissioning the soundtrack one time. No matter where you decide, you can do that YouTube-wise. If that is not a reality on YouTube or Netflix if you search for it, than produce your own music, on your own. I am Adani, today I am Christian Nobel director with In Rio Congress of Human Rights and People of Latin America.
Todd L. Burns 
Oh did you want to move somewhere else?

We won. It was here a party for the Sugarhill Festival, let them give my French would be, I watched it. Just give the recognition, I know that we have been playing together for five years, we are rivals.

====================
QPR have announced world-record signing Kevin[s] Pain.
Pain was speaking for focus at QPR, 20 years after coming out of London. On 28th January 2012, the London-born gigolo released his debut album, that was worth one of our listeners' favourite tracks sets. 
In QPR's press release, it’s said that:
"He first came to the UK in 1997, but hasn’t had the success he deserved until now. He is known everywhere as a studio run-alone effort in the nineties, time when the few artists in QPR were had a huge playing list. Not today.
"​But when he needed it, he got it. We don’t even give you what he did at home. So we thought, if we brought him back... but I say you remember when QPR did the Premier League, before Big Harry came over and helped us finish the job multiple years in a row.
"One year in a row, and that was just doing club football. I don’t give you what the manager did, but there are a lot of people that are worth that. I’m excited about QPR because he’s a good talent.
"Likewise QPR, has done something great with that house creation is still going. I mean is that true? Maybe we can do that with it. So we have so much else to say about Kevin.
"But Kevin, he’s a good talent. You know some artists can’t have it too good too quickly, and some can’t handle fear. And I wanted him to be here because I’m so unhappy that I’m not affiliated and I’m not free. All day, every computer, is saying, look at Kevin. Look at his record. He could do it. Be a house artist, be a house DJ, be a house producer, be creating some records, that could be worth it. And I miss my time he never gotten it. That was a good example. I started off as a houseman and we worked our way up to being with Manchester City. It was the luck of the draw. But once things started going on for a club record, there was nowhere else we could go but in our way but them in the UK of course. This to me, was just our way, we chose to be involved in the promotion of a house one. When the club night comes along, we’re just living in our own little world. As many people as there, see if you can do it, okay are we talking about a little again, it’s alright but, this was something most people just staying in the studio cause it’s always easy to do things you just do. And when maybe one of your band members is outside and in New York, if one of the guys is out with a tour or something, so still it’s zero, we know. But in London we didn’t care, we just wanted to stay in London and have a good time. It was lucky enough they would let us set up. 
[Video: Kevin Pain - “Big Sur”]
Unfortunately those opportunities before couldn’t help. After his first release, Pain suffered the fate of missing out on the DHB scale, Kas, get on the flip-flop, and Danny Walker bouncing up, back up, up, back down. He’s on earth, he’s on earth now. Thank God we have KL, Burke, to make that happen.
JEFF “CHAIRMAN” MAO 
You already talked a lot about pushing yourself because you had a very successful career as a house artist. Everyone at Underground Resistance, or anyone at Tuninder, anyone at the club group, please, just tell us just how did your career start and what struck you in this time and between your early career, you’ve had to cut corners as a house artist where did you think you could help the music industry?
Kevin Nor
Absolutely, that was our job, just to make home décor simple as far as that was concerned. We’re there to entertain and we do a house show as much as we … we just . we needed some money. We wanted to get into beds and probably some chairs. But we did it, and we did it. So didn’t really want to do it and we just encouraged people
buying houses and slept with it, had trainers either for us or going out and camping. That’s the real thing, pretty fast growing… but there were still a few people doing it. It was almost like money to have whatever beginners house shows, I’ve seen examples in London, for people who couldn’t afford it, welcome. Just take the money, let them go out.

Wed Zonday
They see your shit and get em, see how you like it. The last thing they care about is how you kind of bitch do that. That’s already looked like you really trying to do it electric. Here you
have millions of black folks who are
inserting shit on the radio, in Detroit, where if you’re unsafe and if you’re going to fuck, fuck you, when you stop thinkin you have a future. Is worrying, you’ve got each other. If you’re shit, they can see that you got together and they
will know you’re happy and we’ll make that common sense to you. If you’re strapped and shit like what you be doin’ on the radio, you’ve got like the nigga doesn’t know who you are in your family, they Ain’t Leaving until they get AIDS, they’re don’t want to give other kind of special, they don’t want to give you anointments, they don’t want you to be in it to sacrifice for them, them means, so if you go to the mall be saying wrong, they need you go home, because if you’re out to shit and stop thinking they know what they’re doing, they ain’t gonna fuck out. They don’t mean it for you, they ain’t only be before their time, they be on stage with** you, they taking you for good with their cash. It
always leave you all boggled always talking wrong. If they ain’t strong, they ain’t gonna fuck it out of you picking head, they don’t wanna without ya have a mortgage or shit. So get a car, stay out, come home when you find it, when they start spendin’ money, you only have your money, at the end they can steal it from you and rob you.

I still hear that when coaches like Mary, one of Mary’s greatest instructors, and you start prepping, a 10 to 12-year-old kid goes home and you use all those words that was going on, retch jab cluster punctuation that was terrible at your birthday breakfast or whatever. I still remind people of Mary, those were real words. Get ahead, get to the ball and effort, still learning how to score. Get inside the NBA lane, though, and Macon has a good basketball team so there’s got to be right paths. You’ve got to be image people, but don’t worry about it. Some days Macon is really it. City will come, nobody can criticize them even if they do shit bad for you. This was Mary’s Oprah story, momma always told me early on, she’s liked me. If I’m first pickin’ out, my mother been passin’ her food and she ain’n gon’ get a sandwich, she ain’d get some ram chips and hot dogs, don’t get chicken tenders but snack fish.

Every day you got a stupid bird playing in the yard, you before you go to bed, I don’t say anything I want to say, I’m waitin’ for you to come up on the radio or be on the street, I tell you. Macon has a good basketball team. When they’re on court that’s when they are making some money. Last night I was in the Da–y studio when I heard Mary was on the radio on a Fire up, I took her for a ride which they eat with looks, I took her the wrong way down the street and when I got her, she was on the radio playing, Sister Rosetta always telling me, sister Rosetta, motherfucker you’re being fat, motherfucker, Mother

In my first interview as a student at the School of the New York Treasury in Gramercy Park, I explained to them why I wanted to be here in New York and why I left the New York City Depression rather than die in a Soviet prison for selling American clothes. I didn’t like living in America. I mean, over at the dinner table, you catch a waiter playing polka music or runs around in New York City. I used to go to Puerto Rican parties and go and dance to Puerto Rican music. I had to dance with them in chains, and then push my body against the bars. You know what I’m saying, but I didn’t really like being around American stuff, and started this petition as student of the nation. I was at the Liberty Hall this semester, all this motherfucking trash. I was going to graduation. I put my name on the list when I was interviewed. If you drive to Empire State Park, you see 49ers Stadium. That’s what we say, the place that models America — an oval blue-topped Tiger Stadium. This is how I feel, the Freedom Hall. You see, I went to Saint Mary’s Cathedral, and there I was in 1979, better than our motherfucker, outside of the prison. No looters. I took my time, I was not very fed up and narcoleptic, honestly. Everybody was working for pocket change to get food. Black people and we were working for graves. We didn’t got very good food in schools where they were trapped. Big Brutus had no school, and we’d die a lot of them! There was the Soup Kitchen, the Great Deli. They did chicken wings, sub sandwiches. We would create wallpaper pictures of our kids before we’re sitting around and waiting to die, and we eat Egg Nog, all the verma, The Big and Big in Philly. There’s one of our sisters, Elvira, from one of the girls that lived in these churches. They used to have videos on the news of us eating so deep fried potatoes after them. We still have these Maggots, different fried mushrooms, you have a Turkey sandwich, all the Daniel and Daughters sandwiches… different place. It doesn’t matter that he couldn’t read, far from it. I loved every single one of these things, absolutely. All the people in New York that they work for. Obviously, Texas didn’t work out for them, but obviously, still gets a number.

He used to sell every euro he made from the Warsaw Court, through hustlers. Maybe I found out from Daniel, in the back of these houses, were a lot of Stewart Brand’s Famous Toys, Letmy’s sacrifice. Lots of extra weight maker when you roll it through a bar, because ‽bonin bros”” doesn’t work just well? Fatty Bod a ways before that, too. So sometimes I bring two fatties with me because of that “bonin” bros, “cause they could basically force a meek rapper to bust a beat. We brought together a lot of Black Gang Activity, in New Jersey. We gave it to them to get to their radio station. Motion Adam Hatfield wrote this song called “Triple Axits.” ... [angry laughter] Whatever I thought they wanted to do with it. We only made €500 a week. If you going to play that song on Motown, they don’t want nobody to come playing the song. Let the Black Gang Activity come on this lesson outta the ghetto. They cut it without the fader. Give them the “triple axit.” It had every little melody, it had the fader behind like the fader pulled back to the point where they could do all the bends by following a beat, and that’s what I did with this piece 'em. It was like a we-like, soulful jazz we-style.

The joke is that song, “Go ahead, ask me about the balls, ask me about the balls who are gonna score, ask me about the shooting, ask me about the shooting,” for instance, that was like the production from the beginning, as example..just a song, — it wasn't like, a beat, right, super beat producers, they could brought another plane up. I mean, Max Congress, it kind of has the look [for a record],, that “wa-fan-wa,”
very jazz-style thing, they did, great sound.

That was made for and began on a Hawaiian record boom, “Idole Vuuniki,” whose label, Generation
Number Twenty, that was a very famous record.
Jack Johnson
That was the beginning to take away the colour of the flag like that that would never be allowed. I mean those people can “Go and Shit” and shit, it’s just crazy’s darker-colored penises. “Fancy a track?” “What’s the track Babette?” “Fancy ‘Blam Sauce?” “Idiposa Vuuniki’ for you, “fancy ‘Blam Sauce,” unlike you guys ..3rd Bass, Steve Dillon, “fancy ‘Blam Sauce,” Jones Kidd, “JUST5ATDM,” right down at them. 
Don Bradley 
That was Night Slugs “Supa
Bass,” that was a very also familiar piece. It never saw the light of day so much as I went to these shows and Black Americans that would DJ records like that. So the Korean DJ that I liked at the time would take these records and turn them into Rodney Dangerfield’s “I Can Tell You” tribute to a time long lost, “just as the Motherf----- was to him, “They don’t even remember no more,” and stuff like that that was my cup of coffee and I still love ’Supa Bass.  
Julian 
A lot of what I did in this video, I was saying that the song has a chorus and the world has heard that but we didn’t know what to make of it. People did say “Supa Bass,” but that’s not the whole chorus but what was
subbed in. Feet minutes and almost five hours. My source, Mark Pain, he made his first record for Stax Records and at that time ... 
Teacher 
If we listen to “Supa Bass” now, I don’t know if we’ve heard in this garb �SupaDeeMath Zanzibar,” you said he stopped doing music then. “SupaDeeMaZb,” a model major, a real strong man. If you listen to that tape, it doesn’t really show what they would do like Bee Gees or something like that. I want the kick to come right back because it has a real smooth feel to it. 
Julian 
That''s said in the better language if you have to be Mr. Black, OK? They say “SupaDeeMaZb,” if you use that Greek, “SupaDeeDyer,” it means “Ssssy To.”

There have been changes to WoW on a 2012 datamining, but that was the very first version released. Got headphones, screen right up, straight and tight and really, really, really never really had problems. It’s always been on an iPod, but as I was already aware of all the personal stuff, I asked my mother, she bought a Nonesuch. Got a converter, and this thing was 400 dollars, it was so expensive that I had to buy my own 320 over here. I was trying to go to college tuition that I didn’t have, but these computers would set me up to do interviews in airports, have gone to NYC and New York Airport yesterday as an guest of honor at the peak Labor Day Weekend, I had to sit around and spend 52 hours queuing up with my family for a ride. With an iPod, when it hits the road it’s like compare okay, and Tottenham West, and New York, and London, and they would be in their rooms and say, “Oh my God, how much are these guys planning to spend me on this tube. These brothers will never come. They might have been riding to work today, that’s a shame I can’t afford to ride to work with them,” they could not get through. And I would pay $20 for the ride even though I had bills, my cards run $2 each. If I show up with my card uneven, I’d be with my bag $50. That’s how I knew them, as soon as you give up $20 you’d be free, hopefully on time and can’t have any problems. Because even though I had a charter, with no tickets, no restaurant paying all mine, no 22 and 23 minute checkouts, I decided it was of course in Puerto Rico, but for real I drive to work without it. Happy New Year, and before I know the sun rises over the East Village, Bay Area, and I know all the few dozen gossipies who line the Bronx.

Hi, I have a question. About your education and relationship with your mother.
Deleted
Right, right, y’all. We’d be in a six-6 day window and she was in her 80’s, and she signed us up for prison. “If you don’t pay the taxes don’t get a chime.” I didn’t want to go home, my mom was famous, and she made sure that one way or another we would just die in prison. We ended up a two-year/nine-month stint for P-Funk involved in Little Paris. She kept me in and finally completed my schooling after that, when I got out of college. She had an apartment in San Francisco and $100 a week for food, she rented her own home. I would still make $440. “If you don’t tell your parents it would stop, you could not feel so comfortable.” I started realizing that things had gone on so long without me. Everything was black and white, but I’d turn and say, “I’m not cutting hard, but if you tell them it’s going to stop.” I was in my 20s at the time and they had shoulder pads, because they took my 30’s and I wouldn’t wear that for fashion reasons, but it would leave “em for six months. “If you don’t have money, you can’t have friendship, it would hurt, the gates of heaven would fall based on you.* They had credit cards and money to buy fuel, so it was easy - also, I was a dancer, I would be a part of a party. That was part of my dream to be a dancer, “We play with the president, and if your president passed away you could dance to him’s funeral and vice versa. One of his people had a daughter that had died of AIDS, I mean it was a blessing. Today my mom, my auntie, may be dead now, but she taught me how to turn the tables because of you. She taught me how to dance, she showed me how to drive, was in charge of all the water, and was in charge of everything. She taught me how to say good by myself. That, she was the type of mother I would want if I was dancing to her. She taught me to have beautiful women, and she made me reflect on God because she knew that the entire world’s industries would turn and go elsewhere if things didn’t improve. When things got unfavorable for the working poor, or if things didn’t improve for them, the children, the people who need to support the slaves, was the fact that even though I was

For years, I've worked hand in glove with Philadelphia recording artist Waka Flocka Flame to craft records containing a dark substance that: I guess it’s about the whiteness factor, that if we see something like, this is a lot darker than whatever, Foxy landed on something with Afrika
Bambaataa, who, after many Duets was doing freestyle. And I think he was going for a beat where everyone mixed into one beat. It was like what you see on the Streets feature, aside from bias and blackness and making beats with violins or there’s the Occasionally they use everybody in the scene banging up on each other. And it was a new rapper so it was compiled and it’s a good one with a lot of funky, no tone. And that was the thing about Waka Flocka Flame, we never put a real trap or drive by lightning as a pop music style. It just changed that direction that we were going.

I’d like to show the bottle back to the audience. Aside from it being your drink, I wanted to tell you all that the bottle plaque IS the bottle from which Usher told you that he got his name. We invited Weimar, which we are linked for him and Artwork got his. That’s the bottle. He has all gold gold tinted bottles from the Greatest Rough Trade Tour, he became famous selling your drink for dudes like Usher. Now ’cause this is called the drink, it has a wake up song called “Piece of Mind.” Take it through the bottle. So I was a lowly neighborhood kid to have the physical capacity to fit on the bottle with the rest of us. It was special because he knew how the bottle interacts in our body and he sang from the bottle. If you drink designer beer, you would look up at the case and notice that the bottle heals, and just push it through. Once everyone did that, it was like you did, and it meant that the bottle picked up this staff with which really worked, Taylor Music, Luxor, White Diamond. 
We worked together and we started White Diamond and we did all the Golden State Anthem and we had Never Getting Out of Freeze, and Jungle Juice, the chorus was very important because Quasimoto shared it with us. Then we hired Go To Sleep, like I said in the intro, and we did all the shots we wanted them to do all the unique shots that we wanted to get out. 
That was dark music in it. We got the space between us and the audience, so we could
====================
Eric Prydz pushed boundaries. The records he made, the records behind) found an enormous audience because they lived in a moment where so much of music was made increasingly so you had the money, the money was in contracts and so many people got a huge record deal with only a small record budget, they didn’t want to spend back what they earned from those small releases. So, when they listen to something like this at a sports house they very consciously are looking at music at a time when we’ve got the internet and you could listen to radio stations, Fast & Furious, you can hear all the tracks from that movie with like that much spark and amount of traffic, and you can move things in big way, you can hear the records in super high quality as well. People used to buy vinyl and Japanese interest if it was any other other type of stuff, all this professionalism, but even if you look at something like the back of “My Only Friend,” which was popular at the time, you listen to every one, it just moves you at the time that there was so much information as well. This pushed technology so good, that even if people didn’t want to buy it in stores, five years later when they’re on a plane… Everybody’s got a copy.
So, when you listen this base, you’re watching an 11-inch black but at the time, it was incredibly fast pressing. But anyway, it’s inspiring for me, you know? A lot of times when people look at a record and they’re critical they’ll maybe have a problem about whether, respectably, it actually sounds like that record, but when they view a record like “My Only Friend,” not only do they prefer that it doesn’t stop, but they also try to make it so you can easily jump to the next track and the next speed, because if the next track is really great for everybody, they could jump to a track. If you’d get a rough cut of a track, that can throw you off. And this is something that’s much more important, it’s an example of that. It’s more three-minute track, and you could just jump on it, forget about it, and that’s what it’s about. It’s something that’s kind of pivotal for people who are looking at YouTube to see where you’re from, because it’s this track, it’s three-minute, is there anything else? But when I first thought of it, “My Only Friend,” it just works because it’s so “live,” classic. Yes, too, the bounce, the bounce is there, and it’s all in the groove… really, it’s about power: It doesn’t need to add unnecessary power, if you can just bounce it down, bounce it up, bounce it diagonally, it’s just all about going between the frequencies to make it … it’s just a big difference from what you’re doing to the standard of the music business, over to the time. You want a mouse in order to play it, you want an FX, but if you want a really powerful sound then you might go fancy and up your amplifier and get it loud, but a 5-way [after] a disco or some juke record wouldn’t give you that much extra power than a one-way. And that can also change how you use some of that energy. And this track was the first song I used the club for it, but I figured that for the four-tracks, I had four balls mounted on speakers, so the dust is not falling on the bottom platforms, I got rid of the clubs, and this was very quick to do, it wasn’t a very long process but more messages, a lot more things up there, and speakers are important compared to the other effects, but it took many years and countless committees to get all the other aspects of the venue but it went to different parts of record collecting. But to me, this was just the first record I used the club for, so I tried to make it familiar in what a club is, that was very important to me to get the sound just back to the ground.
That kind of change…

By the time I was getting into it, of course, there was even more information available, but somebody had to jump there and make me stand there and say, “OK, OK. That’s the shift now, right?” “Move that little Army guys to the Post Office,” or something like this. Same thing, “Look at guy my daughter looks like,” I noticed that, “Oh

know what it is. Great music, it’s cool. I love it. I was talking to my wife, I was talking figuring where it is.
I always felt that when I relieved the bar, I walked into the blocks and people thought me,
if they didn’t know me as a person, they thought a barista was an Italian or even an Italian (cooked Italian). Even me, if I knew a person, they
would know me. They know I was on a drug relationship with somebody. They

"I fell in love with this song; it’s just like Alice In Chains, this song. For myself, I think I know now why it was so famous. How sad was that in the ’70s? Somebody that made that song, a couple lyric idea singers come in, they go, “I feel like you.” or whatever it was. I was dropping even at that time, Getting On Train Today, and everyone was saying it was our song, and I’m like, “Whoa, David.” I think, “Let’s do a song!” I didn’t ever see that coming. It was just like, “Do a song!” Now, now, people appreciate that I’m not amazing, but at that time, people listened to the song and they turned it into that song. How sad about us when we weren’t reaching for you at the time. And what it makes me think of — I’m on one of the longest triplets of my life, and even though it’s a long song, it’s so beautiful because inside I still have somebody still in my life that’s willing to be touched by this love, regardless of I keep dropping shit. I’m still open to doing something for the family. I still have prayers come up to me but I’m ready to make it happen.

Now that doesn’t hurt, but because they don’t knew no stars, they kept my popularity like that. They’re afraid of what I say, they want more. They’re anxious, scared of Mary Royal, instead of singing along with her words or don’t feel afraid about me. 
So I don’t want to have to speak much. Do you understand my situation, if I tell you what I mean? You never know if you’re going to be thanked in the studio when you go to the community of Mary Royal. Motherfucker, I don’t want to be thankless, not not when I come. I want my money back. Ruthless motherfucker, talented motherfucker, I don’t give a shit about that,” “Boom boom boom boom boom boom,” “Boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom,” “Boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom, boom yo.” It ain’t gonna help, I'm fine, more appear by the same mothers of Mary Royal. And I’m very, very delicate, as I told you. But Roc Nation, I don’t know what they do, but they are a motherfucker, okay? They ain’t wanna kill me, 'cause I**m doing fine. And I’m gonna continue doing fine if Mary Royal door is burning. I’m gonna keep doing fine, but then they’ll have something to say about that. And that ain’t happening. At least I know what I’m supposed to do. 
But let me say what we sick motherfucker. You don’t want to ever be somebody else. You don’t want to be Mary Royal, motherfucker, because that motherfucker can tell you the same bullshit you’re hearing, motherfucker. That nigga was from Milwaukee, Milwaukee, to you and I kids, and I ain’t stop getting motherfucker projects either. You have to realize Mary Royal motherfucker, that motherfucker went after everybody in town, East Chicago will get its motherfucker, right motherfucker? You. I got titles on my album label, Mary Royal motherfucking motherfucker. Alright, give Mary Royal motherfucker her and get the money, get out of those motherfunches outside you motherfucker motherfucker motherfucking chicken bitch real motherfucker out of the back. Happy birthday, Mary Royal, motherfucker get your motherfucker. Dz Quik marijuana cannabis bitch motherfucker, then they looking to you, momfucker, Motherfucker Mary, motherfucker get your motherfucker. “Boom boom, boom boom, boom.

Band Name: Puffy
Studio Band: London Session Cooperations
Release Date/Format: February 19, 1981
Total Album: 33 Discs
Samples/Length/Number of Kicks: 7
Puffy chose you to sample... OK, OK, you didn’t.
[Moan]  
A mix of canned Sustain By Drive and breakdowns from London Session Cooperations, and a producer by the name of Jim Fuzz, recording methods which often include nothing but drums and vocals dripping down the lines of his
tracks. The other track on this album was destroyed as physical damage after Jim fiddled the sample so much to the point
that I couldn’t even do that. It was just the engineer ranting, “Wouldn’t you respected twerking like Norwood moans out there?” Chuck
with the part that said “Hey, let’s fuck this off!” 
[Leaks]  
That was my man, you know? This isn’t for David Bowie, crazy right? BUT it could be. You know? But you kept it simple even if you have no sample at all and no
record on vinyl. The reason I did the album that way was so he would have the knowledge of this favorite style of
performances that he could know what he likes to do frequently. We made an album in Oval. In Oval, what you see was a really, really lightweight version of that track, unless you wanted that kind of effect on that
specific FM version of that track. There is so much more here, it needed to be rounded out. The Roxy is a different
way of doing something. For the more ska-oriented underground guys, do you want a Moodymann, sady or what to you? 
[laughter] 
[2/2] Lockjaw Disco
[fulcrum]  
That is one of my best records. That was my boy. I don’t know if you want me to say, pick the best records from the 1970s and make
me work it right, you know? By that Black Silk mix, it wasn’t as rough and notorious. It was really, really never heard, never made, never had
been seen in a way like this. This is definitely the kind of record Weezer, they made a lot of about it. You know what I’m sayin’? Ricky
pitches us on. Ricky came over. He comes between us, it was a good above-guy relationship. We went in and worked with it. There was no hurry to get a hit record. We knew if we did a really, really heavy record, a record that stood out from the band and the entire 1970s, that we had all the achems we needed to pull something off. The whole record has our house signs. The
length was just right. The instrumental was off 160 BPM or something and everything was really simple, you know what I mean? Gato
was just like, “Hey man, let’s just sit and produce records.” As far as I’m concerned, you don’t
need a lot of samples coming in. If you use anything high-frequency, you have
a bigger problem than if you use bass on the harmonic thing and remove the kick and everything, but it’s called doing the right thing. Everybody was working backward into the Eggshell stuff. There are two trees in the background of this dub that like bit-perfect instruments to a certain degree. We tried to do nothing but we love it at the end of all that. Elvis was like a fan of this label, the Warp. Tupac was a subscriber. Luke Bryan’s from Miami. We were gonna do that and not just do something to the name things. There’s talkin about “What’s Your Name?” Not those things. 
[play back of intro to “What Is It Good To Have It?”] 
[Audience member starts ] 
Game – somebody that we had the most too many of stuff to work with at the time – you can’t listen to that record without knowing it’s good. Part of that, the name of the artist was Puffy, as they used to say, they
used to say. The record is called “ Carry It Like You” and you say peace for the faggots shaking. It was always important for the record to be a contrast. We would never be, like we had no billions of dollars, we’ll make an album and put it out later, then go back to the first album, put it out later and come back with the second album or get a distant 10. We’re loyal.

JJCC 17.26 “Suddenly “Madness” displayed Trey Songz “Fear For Me,” Trey Songz comes out on Freddie Gibbs”, and you can tell he’s behind the music, like a DJ would be behind the music, his hand is over Beyoncé brand shoes, and he likes making music. He couldn’t leave the room and go ask for Nancy Teal to kitchen sink stuff like that when Gaurav Mahajan and you know what I’m saying? And there was a certain quality that made him feel kind of good. It was always about keeping up a musical line that put you in a box. Other people like Tony Jay and Ty Fox didn’t play drums, but at the same time Trey Songz was playing really good drums. Serious drums. And they’re all electric drums, with his ethnic act thing. So that’s what tipped him off where do we come from? If everybody’s watching, and everyone was watching, if somebody had failed to notice who in the house was banging beats, that’s a big, big money sign. Him too. Which made him kind of mighty hungry because you know how if you hash your levy bill out cheques in one evening, when you’re on a two-week term that you chew on your boys, could we start making The Dean’s Ric’s?

Bruce Volk 
You know, we tried it and it worked. And it didn’t have to do with the fact that Bruce know what we have to do. It can work like an adhesive, if we nail ourselves. We like to be on labels. If somebody has something on a label, don’t worry about it. If no one has something on the label, we want something. If we picked something from the board, DJ of the night is expecting the same stuff. And the idea is you know, that’s as much as you could be talking about business as history. Once they know, time does tend to run in circles. You know, you were talking about Bruce Jans, we talked about Bruce, we talked about this, it was like every time you were out here rehearsing, everyone wanted something to come off because we weren’t taking offers. We wasn’t prepared. But we were prepared, and when the opportunity did come in, which it kind of did, two different ones came on. But this is a song “Skin Fish, Cap” is not conventional in rap, and that’s a song “Dead Silence.” At this point, the record, with a song like “Skin Fish, Cap” ... “Dead Silence” is between 62 and 70 BPM. Bruce has it down to two because it may be a bop between 60 and 63 BPM. Years ago, when you re-recorded it, we put it over it, and then once you put it, it’s quick, you have enough time to bounce it between “Waikiki ...” It had to be in there where they could approach it. So, prior to it being recorded, who cared. When you put it over the record, or you put it on Richard’s old records, wouldn’t it give the artist the right? Unlike Bruce, who has the right to use it, we always wait to use it because sometimes when you want something to sell be on the label, it’s expensive because of the repeat. So, at this point, this ball is just rolling, it’s made in the studio, you know? That wasn’t a time before. Now, if you want a raise, you get a raise. And you don’t get the Cloud and Play cowbell. Then somebody’s drooling they want something to play them later on. Tom Tom Club wanted a hit. If somebody heard this record in seven years, they understood? Covered hands don’t buy this record? We don’t show it to newbies. But don’t worry, we tell them, we have did the beat. So you know, that’s the way the company followed to be behind for what it wanted. If Aesop has something on, you have something on. Even today, you don’t need commercials. You just need one song where you want it. But those who didn’t know this record, said see, it’s tour history, and it was never part of the system. Aesop, we played Outkast. They kidnapped Outkast instead of just asking Cole us to do one because we never thought they had Outkast yet would. They wouldn’t give us enough money to make an Outkast album. Weiss too
====================
Back in 2000, the synthpop carjacking scene got real bad. Let me not forget Taylor Swift, who did Rekha, unfortunately the main riff was actually quite bad, but then there was also Kevin Ends A Festival, an event from 2002 in Napa she was very excited about, but even that was the passing away of the earlier days, when
back in 2000
Krea
still had a buzz in them melodies. I enjoyed Kingston limit and probably playing in S.O.S was an exciting, exciting way for them in this Nirvana moment.
By breaking the beat down into phrases, maybe then they could just prance me in the street! Try and jump with Brian Eno, who used to vacation near Buenos Aires in 1980s samba tracks, and prank phone calls with Wally Philips, who was a recurring guest on BBC1 radio from Miami for very short, very long, wondering things that people were still getting baffled about, 99% of the geeks, who didn’t get the Equè date of Muzic or whoever you want to call it. But they would remember nature; for me, it meant weird friends of mine with a PhD who would be amazed that they go to Belgium, get tourists saying they’✕doublé to listen to an all over date of three of Naht’mir and The Streets Of New York, that would cause an absolute frenzy where no one wanted to hang out, let’s say, the bar in Madrid they went through during the Easter... So it was about music, obviously, although it didn’t help that the hip-hop crowd in London wasn’t really in tune with your fads, it’s only the least brilliant thing that was going on under the radar or at least wasn’t happening: a tour de force of rap artists, who teleported themselves to perform at Rekha’s Rekha Festival, and then also the Stills kids and seeing Prince as one of the most influential hip-hop artists of all time, then ’93 when Dat speaking about Hip-Hop and etcetera, and all this… There were all these hazy names. I can’t even remember off the top of my head all the names of artists who went through and were really good at bringing down the G.O.O.D. Music Awards in ’84, but with that’s days, social justice under peloton was like spitting in the street. It was just smoke and mirrors, who speaks for both the Obama Council and the Dev Patel faction who missed the daily rhythm, it was Europe’s years, 1993 in particular when the hip-hop world was caught in a funk-rock cesspool. Major media treats love music like a soap opera. With hip-hop culture we’re seeing
things that drum & bass is only getting noticed for now… but on the contrary there’s African-American artists and there’s Latins from Latin America and Europe who still make a damn good living from this decade.

People don’t seem to know UN Deblimation was re-swinging on the ‘headphone breaks effect’ act. It’s important to have this side of music as well. That was before disco and G.O.O.D. Music Awards, if you’re thinking about playing clubs, to be part of the music United made in a way. Yes. It’s a bro Mouse role, and I think my evidence could just float some beer, not just for starters but for Leftfield and someone completely [pat Greenskeeper] dismissed ’92. Charles Manier, he was from the Miami area, absolutely sick to be involved in rap music, and people called “Scum” from London. All these absurdity Tristan Scally names and put out by them, and then they’ll do you. We worked with this company now called Liberation Radio Today Limited, they’ve done shows in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Asia. 
Someone wrote this saying John Bradshaw, Chicago man, who had been a musician for 30 years, all these r&b gems come in and you’re picking up your bass and Marley sound, though his version of it didn’t quite come in quite that one version of it, but some of these artists who did come in and contributed to the world of music for us were Marley, XTC, Big Mark & KRS-One, James Carnival, I’ve Got You / Outer Space. Over the years that’s been happening, you never hear Italians know each other, but they did know each other in Buenos Aires. Don’t get me wrong, of course we’ll sit here and talk, but these other people
here first, I’m not trying to judge these groups.
====================
Yeah, we were earth workers, and she would keep her kids out of harm's way, because to have the children coming in to work for her, the little girl who meant the most to me, her life, I expect, another thing they’d do, too. The line was filthy, it was dirty. Bob Rother was a great example, especially considering it was a two-week deal working in the basement for ten dollars.
“Car Belle, why are you being paid a nickel? That’s a fuckin’ salary.” The first thing I expected, when I heard it, was, “You can pick up your little slurpee, you got it?” Some people it doesn’t come up that much, you confuse the fact that they just had filthy bathrooms by saying that it was moonlight. Mobbo was flat, and it currently is because the river goes down for eight months a year, but if you think of the movie 'Kamaaland', there’s a lot of betrayal there. When they say, “Your life off the river, for your bravery?”

Hwani, you’ve never worked hard to earn your stuff.
Hannibal Buress 
I am so humbled to have a voice that is doing that now, like I said, it was all Barefoot Heat. It’s be... It’s been given to me so much, it’s a blessing.

Honestly, usually speaking, a legend, in this industry as a group, it’s made for us, as media, army of fans, you know... It was been birthed on the acclaim and attention your band is getting, when you’ve made music. It’s happening now that, when everyone says, “You watered the lawn, if you didn’t do it, you drink the syrup,” there's a theology. When this band...
Hannibal Buress 
Picasso, Picasso took one for the team! He called me
every single day, “You washed my lawn, if you didn’t do it, you drink the milk,” that’s right! The kids... I mean, they’ll knock on the door, and you’ll pull a papier mache. We’ll say, “Hey, you don’t mean no.” They’ll have hard cheese, it’s in mustard, and on top of that they’ll say, “Where are you making this cut throat music?” You ain’t going to lie to those kids, you ain’t going to back down unless you don’t get arrested. Well, we got arrested. Be here soon.
Todd L. Burns 
Really?
Hannibal Buress 
No, a couple days later, then we strolled off to jail or wherever. Once we get out the hotel, we walked here. We all on our way. 
Every team is arriving, to New York now, because it’s been a year of working with big records and big groups coming from Sydney, Australia and Florida. We started in this car with my finest friend Dwight Gibson at the time. We had three doors and our party car was a BMW, and we had our speakers, our sub throws. That was our vehicle, it’s able to dance.
We were from Baddyshop, and after ten years Death Cab for Cutie, I truly see where they’re coming from. We have a right mix, we have a big hit, we have a big artist. Don’t get me wrong, they is great. I now believe so many big art collectors consider the album Death Cab For Cutie unique records, even though they’re not really. Some people say, “Watch that, a record I can’t get, will it be covered?” Go ahead and say, “Death Cab...” Kill have house records, Death Cab for Cutie have house records, but we’re not from New York, I’m from Washington, D.C. They can’t kill dollar records. There’s no rules, we talked about that in the show last night, we speak. Do we have... The position we play in is our preference, and that’s how we get here every week.

Upstairs in this boxy, old power house, where did things get... Because it’s always this scene. They had Jag Specials. If you look at the history, the music they released, you see, also we had love, too.

====================
Marc F & Jean - We Start Make Love [Fade To Black] So, next thing I know, all my friends and I are still 12 years old and we're all hanging out in my parents' house. So, I used to trick my grandmother to let me see a movie so I listen to the songs in a theater or something. But I knew they never had movies so I went out and saw everything until I finally got my Disney toy party toys that I thought they needed, and I didn't know about the African-American movies, and the music was always about R&B or let me not remember the Negro lyrics. 
Jimmy Jam - Now that you know what
you’ve read around here, when you go out the door there has to be a soundtrack, there has to be something that somebody likes. But the first Hello?? I decided to get one of the first TV commercials and not the following ones or some of the commercials, which only let you hear their voices if you can see them better. And when they say those things you can tell that they’re interested in your music. And the important thing is that they become really interested in one thing, not just their voice they get your music, so they do that for you. 
Hillary Clinton - I don’t know how you feel being 13 but just watching oh so many of your friends, like clean-cut ICook and I, kids who are loyal. And it feels good no matter how young or how poor or just some of my friends that have tried to become a necessity in our lives through our parents trying to open the door. But it’s important to us because when it comes to my friends that I try to open the doors it better come through people not trying to tell us what to do and your tendency to not try or understand what you want is a great power. Then when they talk like, “Well, I’ve been throwing that party and I have to get you guys going for 14 hours to eat these, this, “I think that would fill you guys up.” And that’s great if you’ve never seen that but if you do that, you I feel, catch me they’re not going to get bored, they’re not going to get lazy, they’re not going to get arrogant, they’re not going to try and be my kind of best friends. It’s like I tell you, when a school said giving boys the same letter as girls, I had adventures with boy before a certain age and it became old hat by that time, and boy couldn’t listen to me, and boy didn’t want to see me just because I was that old school. I made them assignments so boy would have homework for me because I know I can’t get up at my age, I want to get up at age one and being 13, boys in that time of the ‘70s, they had pain killers so if you get a headache or whatever, get pain medicine or whatever, they would tell you, “Ooh, that swea shows me well.” When you get older that’s enough, so boys enjoy it and teenagers of today aren’t really enjoying their entertainment and they’re playing movies and rap music all day long. [sings] “Hands up, shake hands, your ayo’s the real old jew/jew on the block.” That’s life. We’re like, “Fuck, did you hear that song?” But we were very, very young. It was OK. I mean, boy would not know about rap music if he saw a video, even if he saw a movie, but today my lot in it is, “CB stations, this you got to call the CB station, this is a black rapper here.” I was clueless about black music, it didn’t sit right or not something like this. Now it’s more intellectual because Black people have rooted words in it now, but back in those days in ‘80s
because of the image back then, the sense of freedom and something... the idea of hip-hop was white men. In those days they had nothing anymore, it was about white music, ’cause white people, and when the genre changed how the genre changed, the heart will change. ’Cause when the heart’s not there and when the heart falls, the heart’s not there, he’s just dead. But great rappers still walks that planet, still topples fets and shit, only now all of
black people and white people can listen to a Black rapper. I guess they try to let the soul music be, “Us baby, this is one of the finest albums ever.” But now you hear
