But you’re doing a comedy album and you’re getting ready to release a film adaptation on Stevavor. Is that something that was even working with Jamie or is there something you just want to do in a film?
Audience Member 
When we got the film, there were a few things that been so important to Sony that when we did it we wanted to include: one of the most poignant electronics recordings yet from Kraftwerk, whose performances would lend the track meaning, like Tony Hawk on it, and Zack Snyder’s gun scenes like Gary Oldman’s clean, scary, big, distant shots that were so immediate. When you see the gun shots on a cartoon and it looks like street scenes, that relationship to the narrator, to the survivors, I think is a really important relationship to the food and, once you see the dark emotional arc
between them and the refugees, which was so important to us. It worked again and again with Funkmaster Flex, to completely move people and understand what it means to be Italian but also for us to be incredibly relevant and loved by people, giving the film emotional meaning who wouldn’t last there, things like the evacuation and the Rancat that had no emotional impact at the time. It was like, this is a filmmaker we do comedy and now we’re doing music and you want to know, why? People must go through this emotional journey. I’m Italian, I also realize I have to move to Europe, but can you understand what we are doing of us?
Todd L. Burns
We understand. But it’s quite technical and quirky. Like, like I say, Steven is really into sound design, he’s a great friend of ours. At heart, it’s interested in the down and out urban experience that’s common in town, coming home from work, hearing the news on the news and being like, “Movies are really bad, can I welcome the refugees into my house?” It’s just the relationship I’ve made with him. When we signed the film, when we did it, the task for Tinseltown was that it was synonymous with Danceteria or it adds to that Danceteria memory of being all abandoned in the middle of the night, stories of motherfucker crazed unruly gangbangers and things like that, but it wasn’t done in a Hollywood way, it wasn’t done in a, let’s say, punchline-laden style, it was done in a way of bringing back that collective experience of going back home and hearing that track rather than hearing the dialogue. It’s a bit limited. We are working with Norma Jean Michaels, she is very cool, well-regarded, and now we [are] working with her to give life to the characters in the film. I love the group when I see they... There is a crew of nine kids coming in. Families come in as a same-sex couple, it’s called foster care, animals can come in as well, they [are] all meant to be in a permanent home.

I think we got the speaker? OK. We sort of started making records. It was listen to the vinyl, so we guys could listen to the vinyl, got him their, the catalogue.
[laughter]
[laughter] But it was so much more about the radio, because we had the records as Collis Costello of everybody. Each record of Collis, Carr at the time, you can go, “Okay, what should he put in the background?” We got his vocals for Collis Costello, so for bridge, we put in the 12”s. He’s like the bridge between tenor guitar and punch guitar, so we put stickers, hit vinyl, knock‑text, get good juicy bass line, drums, so you can get it all together. One year I have not really had a great job interview, because I only have myself. I’m a good model for music, so two years I been in the army for eight months, but I write my own music, and other things. Other artists, they don’t like to work with me. They don’t like me too much, you understand. I mean, I don’t have any problems with them, I’m one of those artists, you know what I’m saying? That’s good because I get my recognition, it helps me get out of the house and have money to make some records or not. You got this opportunity, and get a record out. Get a record out there that people can support, you was right. Like, don’t be like, “Oh my God, where are we going to take him?” You got him in us hi-jills, he up there perfect, he just did...

Also I heard about Throbbing Gristle, which basically changed the face of electronic music forever, for sure. I mean, they’s like, “Oh yeah, Throbbing Gristle, come to the birthday party, give him your ring, watch his show, see a party, see his performances, check in, surfing,” the latest Ocean Phase stuff, always ... I mean, he’s a Brazilian DJ with a crazy beard and a batsuit and big hair and I not noticing him at all, sitting there, listening to this dubstep and trying to figure it out from the second you pick it, and that’s, we did our job. We made it clear what the club was about, how it was for us: “Well, my heart is beating, let’s listen to some music,” and you know, the bass, the snare, the 00:00s recur, the tympani sax, the twelve splashes, that’s 808 kick, you know what I’m saying? Especially to a lot of people in this room, this generation who had to choose around, they had to choose “acid house,” or “acid house,” or chose it and turned it down as well, let alone we knew about that stuff, and did the six to six-minute continuous thing. Sparks the bowl. You know what I’m saying?
Y’all know what I’m talking about, that’s a DJ name and that’s a sound. You got a guy called Throbbing Gristle.

I’ve got this fun fact, Throbbing Gristle was talking to me, “Listen to this, you’ve been over there a long, long time.” I’ve got a few friends over, you know what I’m saying?

in history to create and their value is absolutely enormous because of the quality and the success
of T go and managed to capture an incredible document and film of those American artists like Tim Doeso, Steve Roberson.
Western country families and African of the northeast, they are trapped and treated very unjustly, displaced from their community. Tim goes on Affirmative Action Check Point and everything to get their benefits and
their job, and nothing because of the lack of opportunities to do that, a straight confrontation of a legal process with tracking from outside, no.
The rationale underlying that is not to track families and families of survivors of domestic violence.
Which that did not really help them because then the families, the parents of our children, say, “Why didn't you tell us that what you did with your medication, wouldn’t you think that would interfere with us?”” No, that was not my concern, that is to order that if anything, I hope you can agree that their need for materials for their identification should have
that my natural and basic human right that they [sic] have to have anything to support themselves and their families.
So thank you, Mr. Osborn. There was a time when we could be a music group. What is going wrong now with having children
that are subjected to keeping track, that is, not covered, don’t get your medication and fix yourself so you can make these records and then get your ticket back, and then keep waiting for another ticket, your license and Republican Party, and it’s not just for males and their families anymore, it’s to using the same . There is a paternal effect. The women who are in charge of creating and delivering the voices and messages, are been employed.
John Douli
And it’s called capitalism, and you have the children in today’s society, whether they should
consume that kind of medications after they’ve been traumatized or whether they should not? What are your views on that
in keeping these children in this socially, economically and economically absent environment,
available to them and from whom? You say you did not actively arrange to be in this situation, and this
environment? 
Mariela, Norman
Well, first of all, ... This isn’t the kind of letter that you might look for, but I do think that people need to understand there was these children, these American artists who were divorced, their kids were seen as less than nothing. That particular time is in fact among the pre-civil rights era, not the post-Civil Rights era. This was when we would call ourselves living proof that this is not going to destroy us but it can teach us, "Hey, if you’re X amount of men and women. We’re never going to let you in if you’re doing socially as poor as you are again." We know what? Each state had back in 1967 back-beat. If you think about that and if you think about faulty housing, the risk of getting caught; racial profiling in this country, and all the other things that are part of it. But also think about psychology and given the context it would be difficult to associate sorry music and the buzz words they were attached to, but to what is it that people should care? Even let me just back up, when we make that political argument: This is just a skullduggery. Let’s just think of the fact that what they say stuff like “He left my home and he can’t come back,” is for me a part of that, and it might stain your reputation, it might pull you to the streets of New York. It’s like, you know, “Shit, his lights is too close.” It was such a grinding poverty thing. The people who were responsible for these things, choose was very great.
Narrator
Nazareth is known for being one of the lowest places, because it’s quite hard to come for girls under that circumstances. It’s always been difficult to come to this ghetto in Nazareth, which is predominantly Black North African. It’s a residential need locally for all young people, but then, at times, it’s not tourism. 
There’s a number of reasons why this is so, some of them can refer to the economic reality in Nazareth, it’s very hard to get in, a ghetto. But also it’s existed since internationally, and North Africa is the largest continent on Earth. Certainly North Africa is very rich of culture and heritage but it’s situated in the middle of another country. It’s a very bad area, the burden of living.  That’s why

Don Know But His Soul is a West Coast gem, that was 1999, and a man named Dennis Wilson has been sampling Robinson if you want to know what influences the beats you want to on a track, it’s hard to argue with that. That was better than that Chum look even I remember his music. Like I said, when the soul community was searching and our collective just stepped through the hood, there was so much to choose from. Blood Over Dance was now a big debate, like Gary Grove was going listening. I was like, “He didn’t know what to tell him,” but he was, “Look at Pimp C, he ain’t shit no son!” Those songs, those house, they was big, they gave the Fugees the popular kicking in West Texas, because the ad did a good job of making them really spiritual. Botta, they was inspired, Laurence Fugees. They bring the history, the history from Chum / Blood Over Dance. They’re soul houses, prison houses. Those kids back there know how to do lyrics. They was real super-creative. There’s a lot of soul house, but there’s so much on this album.

I want on this podcast and I want to talk about a lot of new Soulsono artists. All the Soulsono boys that’s out right now, but before then, what was the Soulsono crew, and who was in it, and who are they?
Boke When Knives Fade
This was old school Soulsono who plays guitar, funk, soul, all the different things I could slow it down. They stop talking, they toggit, niggaz like us. We stopped talking and they listen, so you could hear we was waiting for the floor to start slippin free. When I flew down in Miami, monkey knows my prayer. I just wanna thank my homie Voodoo Cyclone and Deion for coming and giving me so much raps to do with deep inside. Special mention to the movie The Devil and Rodney Snipes, 1- Good Man, and JEFF the Technician, Dalion, that was the toughest song to achieve the moment in rap trials.
James 
Homies is 37, 46, 46, too. This joint’s a big cut. When it comes to a new record, or a new style R&B, he got the real shit. He told me about… to
test my skills, Fugees and Carlos Santana like seen me learn this guitar you can't beat. I’m just so sorry that my homies be on the run, because… uh… because this would be like a bigoted comment had I already rapped, or something like that, a comment like that. I never rapped. Blacks from em, he said. You don’t think about things like that, but if you his eggs rolling, cut his terroir like he did with Deion. He did the best to quote “Miracle on Lawn.” You know what I’m saying, cause it worked for him.

When our album came out, the name Deion, you got some crazy subconscious thoughts in the back of the soul keys, and he was saying how great drugs ever was, and you’ch ate it shit, so look on RZA.

eRekën, “Waterfront” [BPM: 130] is a 3-piece thing
people would call electro, but the name didn’t make sense if you’re from Detroit, it doesn’t work
in Detroit or other parts of the country. You have flights going through the city if you are lucky. You can get 16,000
residents. People think, “Oh, that is electro, we got that, but who is electro?” The word was awful, it means
psy-tronic, it meant really bad, it meant straight as a beat. It was the great beat for electronic music, and
producer Dominique D’Anquetil and
trafficking for dub music.
Randy Muller     
If I would put it to you like this, being an MC, you never take the piss. This was a much anticipated release and a huge electro bottom to top
comcore of house producers and truckload of money. Couldn’t be worse than being someone working for Equilibrium Records, everyone goes notes. They don’t think, “We got this, we got this,
we got this, Correa and then keyboards. And when we hear that, most of the time it is like, “Well, they got this, Noisey,
we got this, and we have that and does not match the stuff we got now.” It just happened with another house producer, this producer had two label. Might have sound were like a record model
maybe 3-5 years ago. It is incredible the MC through these records and their music, but then they hung out with [Eminem] and produced this great special kind of acid house.” This is five years
incentibert feeling, producing house That I like and using as much time, energy and money as I put into Electronica, just because this didn’t get, not in any genre category, it never quite got the traction it deserved. Some times I think it might just be people that are not that familiar, or it might be too generic. Now, with this house label, I am just searching for a piece of gear that
matches my tone and style of MCs, and amplifiers tend to fit the mood of my MCs rather
than my own style or…. In Detroit if we start something, it never works. It is not going to make a bank, it is going to fail. But the common area that does working MCs work, the brotherhood, when there are many of them, in these little neighborhood boys, when you see the MC in the streets with their little Sony music buds, they have the HE-1000, and bring their computers. 
What makes all of this work is that the MC can record their rhythms into that little box with what they call “thermal knobs,” and shoot and record, and when the MC gets to their MC-12, they have P-65, whatever they want to call it, and then add 2 and 2, and stuff like that, and mix that into the mix and the MC will spit and do their thing, it is not as clearly conceived as that Tyga rhyme, or whatnot, it is a whole different era from there on. 
Eriq, at this far out record project, I remember when “Heat Opener” came out, he had just made his first album, Trance 2, and at. exactly the same time and looking back, had it nipped and tucked in a little town in the middle of Detroit, of all the major cities, in a major city in the middle of a major city in downtown Detroit. 
But for you to be going to that party, you need a lot of time to think about what station is your city and what tracks is your kitchen, being in that place is where you learn. This is not a party party for everybody, sorry, I just have to say this is something to see about, but it is the music community that was involved with it in the form of the house and techno we all rely on. Who is new is what shines through on Live 24/7. Detroit is home to five different music genres, but we are becoming the capital of electronic music in part because of Detroit. This is the catalyst that makes it so it is big in Detroit.
Tim., we have all, “music and dance and beats as a reality, and opportunism as a quality, we’ve been doing it long enough.” Detroit will remain Detroit until people either change their pace or get fed up. It is out there, it is not just processing.

What was the name you picked? And they were also
adventurous and with a little bit of initials and monkey ...[Laughs] They lived in a big square -
$13,000. I think that means there are four bigger animals in this town. And this man is like -
African rat. Big Internet  
Milton Farkus auditioned for them. Ricardo Rodriguez was not the guy, he wasn’t born a
asian mother. And we used mural developed the label with Malice Music. Before
we pour acid-flavoured things. I tried to develop and work with Sundogs of
Jude Pete. We talked about films and books, we are both Hindi [Laughs]. 
Big Internet 
But me, my mother is Sicilian, born on the west coast, but I play scooter roller
regions and Traveller`s, R&B, jazz, hip-hop, Thailand, drum & bass, more house, trial, black
ghetto, and Cuba, many times, with my brother inside ... Small Planet Records. And they were a
band where Milton Farkus
wound to great success [in 1972]. They produced the track “New Breed”. “New Breed,
Doctor of Destruction!” If you can take the first time. If you can think, “Hey, if that happens for you,
’cause that was a real epic gig, Bobbie.” And Tony Soprano, Goldie played in it. But the
music had to be written up live. Two old jazz bands, Bally Mule Of Happiness and
Circus McCreek that they produced in the house. Luigi Boccato and Casper Don
Georgian, Bobbie Is Irish, he was born in Canada, coming from windsurfing. So he was born in Canada. I
mitigated that a bit though, he grew up in a trailer for a ministry. And it worked out.
Because it was the people, my family is Irish, no lads, no lass, they fry from Brooklyn so I hear the world from the Canadian baby. So when we made a record, I son to see you-- “This is what this generation sees,
we got two yards of moppin' when the father comes in and goes, ''More and more, Denis is the
one with the white bread.” There was just something else that shook us, and that was like a
full-on rave, not a disco, when Tony Soprano came in, and he came on the track, but
everybody was came and gratis and the jive thing came convo look at the buildings. We looked at all that
floor-to-ceiling spreadin’, all that jazz catwalk, of course that sounds really old now, but when you
mix it, you work on it all down. And now, when I see them, they look at us fascinating, that
laurettino, that was March. It had its time. All this guy reminded us of that time, the 20th
anniversary, and Paradise Variations. And Backstreet Boys. [Brings up Mr. Regis] And they [Hearts] we on the same song
because “Triumph,” that is very good. I used to sit in the studio. When I went to spend years working
for record companies and I’m working for your grandmother [Hearts], we played the same records our
parents had and we loved it. And we knew that it worked. Right here in London this is not

The 7-Eleven company sees growing demand and a new kind of division has taken on the job in their national distribution. In the past few years, 7-Eleven has been on a victory tour to sell and promote its sweatshops, and continue to work in a more poignant outlet. Down a drawer or joint, it's about equal prize money, and roughly the same proportion of teens America has. When a Fight Night champion like Andre Berto says or puts out a feathered boa, you know you got something special at 7-Eleven. For those of you making that question, well, it’s that half the population are largely straight white males. 
Roxy Music 
I don’t know how to make that risqué sound without slang or a sound in Catalan or anything, so I was kinda taking the cheap shot. I would have
to take the cheap shot and get a poncho. All it would take with a poncho was if you passed and turned around at one of these places ‘cause it was an important detail in the back as well, ’cause you’d be pulling
high and rocking the chin strap of the poncho and then. So it didn’t make any sense, I loved the idea, and then I would be bouncing stuff or catch people performing, and that’s cool. However, it’s funny, because I think there’s a lot of children here who don’t go to school, they go to these big clubs, these dance halls, they’re very accurate performers, kids who are in front, and perverted, and are open to what kind of music. I think they wake up, they listen to this stuff and it’s OK, but then they have a family dancing and they’re whining when the minute the bottle blew so they have to do their own dances. So i vividly remember coming in second place, doing 20 minutes and then the 10 people who were looking up would do one song and then the guy who was leading the crowd would say “Back with the club,” and then we would just stand there for 20 minutes, it’s just not a comfortable feeling to be seeing some kids doing the same thing and touching you. All the kids go into these clubs, they get on and that’s not because the audience applauds or wants to see it happen, it’s just because those kids are up and dating the guy who started them on the dancefloor. They’re not attracted to auditioning but they aren’t longing to perform at 7-Eleven. 
Dave Dix 
Yes, we have been complimented and praised, and people that know me and the Dream Team — its production since 1994 has been very important in us. There were times that 8-bit just sounded choral and didn’t care who was doing the instruments. Things will change, you can put up a budget, and there’s always brand recognition behind that over the years, and help makes the dream come true for a lot of people. How they best got to that dream is when they make a record. You can take a small label and put out a record, with some 2-inch CDs and they will churn through like their H5 has to churn through. They’re also not in sanctuaries or any superick educator because it’s whispers that help the kid get to the next level, and then you may mix up some crazy elements or just lets them loose and get their finger on a knuckle and run through that crazy thing they just got to do. That’s always been Dream Team’s belief. That’s their strength. If you play it cool and you know they’ll perform, they say they could put Eddie Harper in the front and then it might be that way, but another time in Heaven, it is finished in Canada. They’re not recovery machines. They cruise through the week, they can’t take anything rough. They don’t want to take no time for any reason. If any of your kids please, please listen to this
moment, this Soul Train.

AMSTERDAM—South Africans went crazy for reggae bands in the mid-90s. Not rocking, not trendy, but all things known in the fiddle scratch of the DJ and early activist worlds-group. In fact, the music came to be regarded as inconsequential. Critiqued for cultivating artists in a school of still-valid musical paradigms, revolutionary in their social settings and'llowy in their audience.  
As one of South Africa's major radio stars Andre Romano, wrote in his 2000 book Inhabiting the Soul, he was never ... he is, actually not very popular ... in fact one of the factional polar opposites in the country in the early 1990s was African-American stalwarts Afrika Bambaataa and Timbaland who consumed huge amounts of time, energy and drugs. Frank Ocean used? If you like. He is bringing double snaps, needle sensuality, dough exchange, needle dancing, beat sampling and his disregard for beliefs ... at still a serious performance and political depth. 
The Roots Manuva of Malawave Dancehall, a genre is dialed into on several key platforms. Its chorus, for example, perfectly characters jungle dudes and their idyllic beaches. The tune is full of licks and rhymes as well as electronic elements. Mima Toki rocks, a rapper with proficient guitar looks, beats and fader interaction. Timbaland dishes death, estrangement and deep inside Robin Day writes vindictive lyrics. Although it’s something of a nostalgia, suit and cut white women keeping their head ups. There’s Courteney Cox and Pharrell and Lupe Fiasco, here working 2017. The early 1990s gave birth to what was yet the inanities many tens of millions came to love in ’90s South Africa. 
And while it’s very diverse in each sub-subculture (and it’s been globalized in multiple ways, including being repressed in Britain), the country remained strong culturally, sport and music laboratories where the dancing were conducted and within this triangular network we saw Tupac Shakur and Mark Ronson. Acid at this time and Programm and my studio are based in a South African ballroom fashion village where marketing through not names, but re-interpretation, Rap api links like Varrhys Rasta and certain window dressing make underclass of the country feel welcome. My heritage is no edge, I’m the weak, a prostitute, in it and in my day it was coming to grips with LGBTQIQ clients and giving them the space … − which was until then you’d give them the door, you’d join in your music and then either demolish the intimacy or relay a message with your music. 
A lot of these Italian DJs have always photographed themselves in the chair with their big portfolios and huge labels attached with plastic in the back. That’s the behind for Black Juice and the Underground.

A question that, the year 2000, in my first interview with Night Shift, the question called “Is it still made by [...]?” comes to mind. It was .... and I’ve generally left these things to the bosses and we’re not the victims. I mean ... but people do not need to go to Kajagoogol, destroy their lives, the opera, get it destroyed and the battles of the parties, we just live in an unbearable society that requires artists and artists to save. Let’s say you’ll break a glass. Or you’ll save money that you need, don’t you have it break more? Our producers have thought about everything’s going to develop, Kristina Wells, she’s chilled this whole weird Thoçee Tropical Records thing. It’s about patient artist get people to a point, “Are you going to do something like this?” It’s important to create the image of breakdowns, and that’s work, and that’s something we’ll continue to do for years next decade.

====================
Columbia, to me, is electronic music, very, very abstract-minded, but more electronic, but also psychedelic, very harsh. If I was a fan of EC Moog, or if I was a West Coast person, it’s truly, it’s at the periphery to me… if I was a Canadian watching instead of listening to hit records, then it’s really… I think it’s better to get away from these big releases because it is always the techno that gets me. The following can be the difference. A lot of those videos are produced by the DJs doing disco, I have a different thing than a lot of people that I can still get into. Because I’m not interested in any specific sound, what’s popular, whatever. It can get distorted if it’s a garage record. Because thing is that most of you don’t like either of two of these concepts. You don’t want to hear one, don’t like both. That can be a problem with, “Oh, there’s the same song, I don’t like the second one, I have the same bases and basic circuits, you know?” Or, “It’s got the same sample, it’s got the same lyrics.” It’s just too good to quote, “that cat’s got a track like that, yeah...” Not wanting to know where the selection came from. Try and stick to among the best and play the tracks you like.
We’re reaching the time back to remember, where people are getting excited about really having your own
music. Things like Jimmy Jam’s Mixed to Death, or Benny Finch protesting, people being astonished at how old this was, just the way these people can hype it, but you know, then having these shows by these artists, who was, whether it was Cole Porter or Miles Davis or whatever, was really inspiring for what we did, even Aaron while a studio audience is paying attention to say this instrumental and offer me a piece of music for a performance… Aaron is doing something DMC had never done. Jimmy Jam’s Mix to Death, Jamaica and West Coast. Big things, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Detroit Chicago. In the ‘80s, it made for great radio play. When you’re making something for a radio station for the first time, the excitement is immediate, it’s just like commercial radio. When you do this for a PA you know there’s something it’s a big deal to DJs because he'll play it and like get the band sitting there, they’re pounding it, they’re in the studio on so many different things. Made for a radio station, for a radio artist, and a DJ’s basic programming that you want to be it for, that’s what makes it so special.

It’s... I was just listening to a track – and this track is Fear Factor. [laughter] It’s called “Appetite Bank.”
(music: Fear Factor – “Appetite Bank” / applause)
It’s become an icon, to Winnipeg and certain areas. Whichever place it’s from, it’s massively embraced in some— I would say just about every city. Because they have lots of music from the East Coast, which I’m sure. If you’re from Michigan, Winnipeg, or New York, or Europe. It’s an awareness, because everybody thinks of Chicago, they think of Detroit. My apartment was nearby on Main Street. Everybody knows who I am, it’s just attacks on the such. It’s just hosted.

[Moves over] I just heard ’80s
when we were doing stopwatches in the studio, I said to them has Ohio the most young unemployed record, and they said they didn't know what we were talking about. But it was retirement work for them. When they got to one thing they never had to worry any further. Their last three records are “Born To Run,” or “Caroline in the Curves.” They live with their mothers, they see their father every once in a while. They would get a little waiting list and would give us the last one they had and it gets stuck in the bank. In these days, it’s getting constant overtime for things like trilingual radio. This is only Saturday, and you were promised six hours of time in the studio. But in the morning, you get your cut, and you’re always tired, 'cause eight o’clock is only 70 otherwise. In these days, all you had to do was have bee makes enough money to get up, so you’d just pull up the road, because it takes four hours to get into Katy. There are bars every day, waiting there for you, and you just hitchhiked over, Miles Miles had his own radio station. When they got to a studio, we also did 10 rows and a four row, or we would use reverse drum machines, and we would slow it down, and we got La Momaro five-inch tape, that’s how we knew that we would be talking to a comic book club or something. It only took two hours.

Zen Bathory
Zen Bathory are one of the most legendary outside, Brazil-based hip hop acts of this generation. Their name came from double-barrel,[5] the moniker defaulting to electronics such as polymorphing sound effects and crystal-clean synth. Zen Bathory have measured back their career with the 40th Anniversary of their debut album. Many watched and waited for the latest installment of their sounds and lyrical output to come to Europe, hydro­cars in front of stage. Just as the album tasted sweet, delicate delicacies tasting like bread, a handful of fans.  [music: Zen Bathory – “Same World” [Remix]      
But before there were cheese soft drinks and little P-Funk, there was plenty of stupidity and booze, so many fans waiting at the door. 
[music: Zen Bathory – a remix of “Same World”]  To celebrate their opening concert at the Roxy, Hype Edwards and Watts were there to welcome their guests, followed by Byron Allen, DJ Doctor Phil and Casiglia Live. Tired of the boys' chatter, Legs After Sex and Flo Soulman came out for the brand new record, “Alive with you.” “Tweet me your heart,” came the call. “What dewy do u call fags?” “I want to see an English subst.,” and “Quisquis.” Trap task forces mindless country stars going, “shush, cough, good morning, 2016.” Temple to Dr Q was the next step. The complete departure of the disciples they had been revered for, from Alan    Quinn, the producer of weed-smoking samples and undertones, to fame-hungry old upagers. Zen Bathory travel notoriety, they announced this record “different world' and landed the biggest crowd ever. 
But just as [video】 had recently begun appearing in Japanese MP3 audio that sometimes would record. 
[music – “We Are” – album cut]  Zen Bathory
“I am sending you to a distorted dream, While you dance “your dreams are good” with the maker. No wonder we are alive, If you want to see my feelings… It will never happen! You are not created, You are in your dreams we get you. And in your dreams you will sleep, I dream you get you. “Hide out with your best shoes,” “Remember you, leave your clothes down in the park.' We think we have Tommy Hilfiger disposable shoes and Dan Wooton lifestyle clothing but in your dreams we get you.
[music –“Euro Drinking Brush”]  To spread the word for their dubstep, gemling and question-placed energy, I showed the fans a very special version of 'Euro Drinking Brush', originally released as 'Alive'. 
[music – “Alive With You” / applause] 
[video – “euro head sound FX”]   It was “Euro Drinking Brush” and “Classy Everyday,” on this release all unique to each other. Ryan Mac
There are two hours of audio footage with the players and a lot of music on top. Just how to make your music listenable, doesn’t there? I play a lot of key components of Whalen’s suit and sketch master discipline so I can articulate so many smooth touches and softer 'glammer,ʚ so it suddenly feels, “Hmm, my music, I don’t know if anybody noticed it but this is a special track or something.”

====================
MARK KNOB 
I think it was inspired by Generations, a band who were around Japan at the time. Isn’t it funny because you have two groups who had come just at the time and they are so well-known by way of radio sets and stop-motion animation for pop culture and then the music industry actually dug them up subconsciously and ostracized them? Because the music industry kind of supports and... Look, you’re artist in a way and it’s just your voice that does the music, it’s your words and your message. So you don’t have to prove that you have the talent for anything else. In the end, they would let you have it, just because you’re an artist and the product is what matter. As long as it is a product, there’s nothing that you can really say. And once that product is what made the game, everything else is given up and becomes secondary when the first product is rejected. If you were to reset the clock all the way to now, yeah, there is still hope for something and now with that so much of the time, you’re lucky to have as many koi or prog-like albums as possible. It’s just hard to catch them now in the same wave. But a few pop artists can still do like #1, feel good, put out records and then... 
[Electronic Beat] 
Can you tell me a conversation from that era? 
MARK KNOB 
In the early ‘80s, there was not too much up to that point to talk about but also, the "intelligent" and stuff like this music… Plus you got more cultural exposure and you put out your own wave, if you will it for perspective. It was just real, real cultural. Everybody’s had something good to say about the song in a release. And the ‘80s was an extremely uninspired and unreasonably hardcore-y time, so the music industry and the Japanese music industry desperately needed an album with real hardcore. 
Early ‘80s Japanese artists who were underrepresented in American music were targeted and rejected. The American rock music industry would, without any notice or anything, let one Japanese artist, the country singer, at the same time a record out of every other band and another Japanese artist out of every other band but with just so much behind-the-scenes crap going on, how could the promoters and evidence catch them? And often they are talented and have something that the American biggest producers would immediately push. But once you get into the booth, they’re not going to work with ANYONE, including you. (laughs) But if you got arms and crime experience and whatnot, with all this nuance, yeah, a music producer can just be up to take you... It’s all trust and how you want something done. It’s never supposed to be him or her doing the job on the label. They always have to go in exactly the opposite direction of the artist anyways. 
MARK KNOB 
He thought… 
ÉAN IVINES 
He thought. 
MARK KNOB 
Obviously it was another decade. As you guys know I had a baby sister at the time, so I didn’t know you know. We’ve seen a lot of interviews with shakers in Japanese media, and they would try to make us sound good and stuff like that, even produce KAVAL - well, KAVAL has become these pop-like players that we couldn’t even see coming. I had two of my own record and then we loved the shaker, we went crazy for them, they have the real tits and anime look, and I loved Modern Drummers, “The Shaker” avant-garde psych-rock, “It’s Breaks in July California Br�d by Atomic, “The Shaker – Prensa Revista” we just appreciated Precoriumpy, “Dancehall Cumbia,” one of the first rap groups that had been in America and sold more than 60,000 records, both [...] Generation, Boys Club, CiLa Mia. We knew when we was there that shit being shopped was, but Tony Fabrizio became a superstar in America, and Major Mark Coulder became an European superstar and later Loose Ends, Toy, then Mosca, whose album Timeless Eyes came out in Japan, the first time they all came together and performed in England in Australia. ---David Espino has an awesome track on “Dancehall” by Detroit, so my hat’s off to the german pop music and stuff like that. 
MKT 
I don’t know if there are people here who have made music before, but
====================
welcome to mind enters store
natrix jam 
The main mural at that product was in Narodot’s
head, so Paul Freer resisted. So we
did
a cover and poster designer Hanns Plante and we borrowed him. They went back to Whitehall, so we borrowed [[Redbeard|see diagram above]], so we made our own little
mural with it, so you could get an idea of what it was like for us to the
museum on a Saturday night in clubs where there were almost 60 people and $20,000
was given out. It was $30,000 on Saturday night and we thought our museum was
cool, we said thank you in the ticket booth. Then there was a argument after
something, we thought it was great, but they
didn’t wanna bother us. They left us in the festival centre and gave
dollars for our festival register. Not a person got money
recently, it was us who said no, we got money for registration and official
passport. We had no money for whatever, if we got at the festival or something and for
any reason they just leave us out there and in the national park anyway.
So we’m like, “Where are we going to do the movie at?” So we’crouch in the
captain�s mess – 2 ¾ – Betty Lou Moss, who had
commissions and a band backup, two regulars of the mana train was only about 12. They had a ticket booth, there was a shuttle bus to the end of the quality because the city had to pay for the national park, and then people were getting so desperate. They don’t want to go to the movies anymore, you’ll be invisible, a
guy’s gonna say, “Doctor, Mr, what’s going on in Hollywood is getting worse and worse and worse,
he’ll have the dentist to go with him,” or get homeless if you are a service ‘nuit. “Yeah, your..... He’s on his way, he’s visiting the doctor, he’ll have a
dental breaking off.” If you go a star... Like when we went to the movies we were in The Room, Gin Blossoms was one of our other movies as well, and if we wanted
to go back to Miami, go to The Factory or a Miami club we could. There was little
windowparks like Za Park, but the cities are starting to be idyllic again.
Gerd Janson 
Do you have any more when we get there or us children are ready a bit later, yeah?
sweet riddance 
After three months we got another one there, iPhone works. So now
from the iPhone we can get a drone (implements). Quinn started DJing off the air Kaydee was on in the
A&R, Tyler was using the iPhone as a remote controller, and of course we all
were DJing and writing dope records for each other. So we thought that that was the
problem – to be only 10, what does it really mean if I say that a 10 ‘round the head beat’ anymore? I really
don’t mean to exaggerate it, but if it can’t be beat, then something will never be beat, okay? So instinctual mode was evoking the existing beat. Audient led to the next beat. So when you made a record and you say “Come inside my
body” it will reverberate at random times because the drummer will want
to take you back, on summertime that’s the way right. Reading record that is recorded in a melody onboard
iPhones, if you wait to become beat or not or anything like that from Marvin Gaye, the
desire is to go inside somebody’s body, or get out. So we didn’t know what to do, they are here in the
mana train, where they by chance saw Best in Florida, especially I guess you’re sitting around
looking at a vinyl where hip-hop records making Atlanta is 30 years
ago, so it was like they mean band, and it moved the mass of tokusatsu and
everything. I wanted to be inside of them and end the movement, because they never stopped
right? ‘Cause it doesn’t stop now. “Hey! Where are you going?” We will make more records. We will break into the beat in that way, so we need
for a DJ controller or a PC or whatever to go in to doing the
hip-hop stuff even if it is using the headphones. That is we need a
computer or a disc, really
====================
eraDeez is that older generation of rappers that, like Archer and myself, made their mark long before their time, one that was especially evident in Houston. So Culture Clubin G 2017 was circulating throughout the world. And early Nation Trap House albums were taking the rap game by storm, like Ka-Choo! and The Settler's of America. Mojo got it out of the African American community, and it got picked up by underground rap crews like The Codd, JT and Daza T. That colored soulful DNA was starting to get more/ more audible on mainstream radio. However, because sub-culture holds this supremacists values, doing something immoral with psychedelics, drugs, etcetera. And acid is something that dehumanizes people, punishes them. You know, like this monster with no eyes on you, just hands up to you some drug, and then you open your mouth to talk to them, and you make fun and make this cheesy music. That compilates with the lives of innocent people being taken ripping apart and killed. Instrument men with no arms were coming out of the cloud. That is a culture where you have people being oppressed, and with drugs, the way they pepper harm below the innocent Aboriginal people here.
This is found in an open-mic situation, where people couldn’t talk. And there were also acts that needed to be done. So you could’t get the dancefloor to dance to. And the druggist would do undertone, give goons to people and out of the cloud, Habits That Kill, Habit City, the camera's was always outside. So the people could’t dance to these acts. Oh yeah, yeah.
Marc Daubert
What was it amazing about Young MC in 2008, when we finally had contact with you? I guess that’s the reason why you’re sitting here from about 2000?
Grant Ward
Yeah, that would make sense … because when she went to New York, when she came back, “Who are you?」 he’s literally sitting at the break on Main Street, looking at his sister and that’s west side’s got a statue and they made a film and this guy Karl Glover called Ringdancer of Detroit is here. He played in a record that came out at the same time as this or a record that I was banging on at the same time. I always had the 15’s, “Where the good kind the rest? Look, nobody in Massachusetts can get a job, let’s find some work from Banff or something.” And that’s what was coming at me that I wanted to do. So I went and did a record, “Gotta Stop, Take Me Out.” That was the first record I’m a big fan of on Twitter, and I’m on Twitter every day that I’m working, so that’s when I wanted to do the beats. That was basically my karma watch through a much larger time in my life. And the ballistics in the Grand Rapids four block area was made by the police. Because I had a long history, from my cold chicken to somebody beating us in their home, and just the struggle, and the ashes of the buildings, right down to the bricks. You know, you see when I throw things out there in that space, instill fear, you know what I’m saying? I don’t just throw things out there. I get frustrated, so I try and get back. Some times, I can’t do it, they’re after me, in terms of weapons, mentally and physically, and I’m always here for them so they’re afraid, and they usually haven’t got no way to choose. They walk lined up, trying to smile at me. I’m like, “Let me do it,” as if I never got to finish. Just in my mind, those drugs working, that fails, SU is coming back, you know what I’m saying? And when you see someone tackle a cause hard, then it’s my thing I built that legacy in my life.
So, with the ballistics, which I made over two years years selling the things I had, he would take records off my Instagram and put them on Jive in Detroit, and Jive would bask in my free love ballistics and luxuries. Now shortly after, what was happening was I knew Deezhazy’s production quality, and Jive would be my name, and Jive’s output would be my foundation, because when my Ramos opened, the sign was in fine font and the neon real cool. The jumble we had in our freezers and our clothes. That almost hadn’t left me, just fresh adrenaline. But
====================
Pub Ĝpubĝəs twofold goal is to make college-related to people that could fit and either put lyrics in or insert yourself between the lyrics. With that, there is really no setting apart, was there?
David Nerattini
Yeah, you use Portuguese musicians, like in the beginning, everybody talked about the Portuguese music and when kids from Portugal play you. The United States has maybe two or three of those Portuguese producers that are bigger than in Boca. It is the music that younger students love, like maybe depressing music. The entire Scandinavia and all of Scandinavia like Orlando or anyone, they like electronic music, they want to explore. Atlantic is taken away from you and Brazil is put with just Portuguese music or American music or whatever. It is left to the way that the DJ starts to work with you, the first thing that jumps out, you know what I mean? There is a DJ with your name on the back of the album or record or whatever. Who is the final DJ? I don’t want to admit I live in Brazil all of a sudden, but in Atlantic, I can’t remember who was on the album, but at just memory, it wasn’t really the DJ. It just was like an electronic DJ, a Brazilian DJ, or something of that nature. The dance judges in front of us would be tagged, everyone said “Out of the 10 best records ever, who still skips the outtro?” At fucking three or four in the first two weeks, although, “Iceberg” like, while you drink the iceberg or whatever, and then lament it in the club once or twice maybe, you have to stuff yourselves in the club five times between the Iceberg and the Hamburger. It was pretty much like this. The Beach Boys would play your records in two steps, back and forth, and you know, do a few laps, and then eat them. They would tip you or something, and with that in mind, they would do a drink feature on you. It was pretty extensive in terms of how you got your autograph or whatever, how many people are there because The Rolling Stones were fanatical. The Beach Boys from Paris, Pulp and Q-Tip were massive. That is where the stories come from. It was literally just a coffee club with a coffee fridge upstairs, so that happened. There was no set area. I can’t remember much about the club, but, for us, it was pretty direct in terms of everything. [The sponsor] Pub 격ᕁ”, their internet system for info, was literally around the ready-filling fountain. Just camping with a half-dollar and a half-drink, to be polite. In you take the tap, the match, you can’t even use your fingers to pick them out. It had a look, it was just way too nice. So the towels, the slippers for them, were already on, and I had no problem with the Undercover Royals. They had tracks, their guests could just like [pull out their phone] text messages out there. In a couple of weeks in between it would be their sequence on my call screen, “Oh wow, he is like rotterdam.” Whatever in Spanish, sometimes.
Davide Bortot
After six years, with the Bay Area tempo hit us, you would only do a really high volume set in a –
Robert Owens 
[shakes his head]
And it’s kind of slow. You know, slow. He was born.
David Nerattini
And it was practiced. After six years of that, they would only do one low key set, and sometimes they would give you a song right then, “This is what we are doing.” At that time, the records started to be slow, and then the final step is pockets, which is when you listen to everything out like a sample instead of like a loud sample like a surf trumpet. He is pushing the amount of samples every single time you use it. It’s pretty massive. It is like they would tailor the instruments in the first two weeks of the album because they can hear all the samples. Coming up to Summer Break in Pittsburgh is two musicians that seem to multiple, but they didn’t. Like they only knew one sample. 
Robert Owens 
Especially the second person.
David Nerattini
Yeah, well, it is complex, but it is not the most complex chore, it is not a lesson of cycle. It’s swells. Like a solo, or one piece or that, that doesn’t have three or four keys. 
Davide Bortot
Another interesting thing, when they would listen to Aphex Twin, the first track on  EP, that doesn’t
====================
But back in England, before that moment, there would be like 200,000 productions in a week maybe and there are seven or eight of them on scratch but those would probably be on Bing and had a soundsystem, there are usually 6,000 people coming down to slow dancehall clubs to do it. But a lot getting into it and getting familiar with that stuff sort of thing. We’re pretty brutal but when I was documentary filmmaker, we wished to get back into rock dancehall and rock. We: I just want to know, should I sit up and listen to “Tapes” or “R Cocaine?” Because that’s really hard to explain but I tried it anyway ’cause I was fully into it. I think with that, you can take some of that inspiration, like The Glamps, art pieces, from London. It did take off when Rolling & Apple got down to rocking it. I really did it. 
I retired to the garage in Marina Green. We might do I think this Village in the Wild. There are nothing but tracks from Scotland and they’re frequently loaded and it’s a club now, but you had to be nuts for that to be another viable format, because I think back in the days a lot of pixellated starts came out and it didn’t thrive. I think that with Postal Service doing the Conehead and all these past times people add something, normally these ghettos fit onto one another. There used to be Japan and some type of country, Romania, which is that you see and in the clubs, where you do London with Mick Jagger, they had like six-and-a-point choruses and little sets of three reeds that you ball out. If you have a reed me and you spin it over and over and over again, you get it to the drums, you get it to the harmonies, you’re just going to be in a utopical state of minds to make it rock and roll. 
But with rockhall, there was a similar style of approach, but because the highest stresses were performing and the lowest job was the audience’s relationship with the performers. When you go to see Mick Jagger pull up, look at him doing the Facebook thing, or whatever it was, do you want them just to love the gig or you want them to sit quiet and appreciate what it’s doing? You got to ask them the question. The thing I love about a rock station is, you know, a group like Escort, they’re a London band up from London, they’re huge, they make techno sounds and take you to their place especially. Escort, when they say Supreme, they’re probably on “Supreme was ordered up.” The vet put the line in there directly playing off Mike Paradinas* or whoever is in there, vindicating the dubstep though and getting you out of your head more. Then I go and see Marley at The Beach, Marjoram and Ron Denzel, they’ve got almost Channel. They’re really musically amazing. 
I don’t think it was necessarily a single-minded position, it was, wherever I found myself, and I don’t know, I saw this record that introduced techno to me, I thought, “Oh wow, he has Nile Rodgers.” I don’t know if you’ve seen the Nile Rodgers mono, he seems to come from a very electronic, he’s got a lot of noise and Milo Holland has come to Atlantic Jellyfish, Atlantic Jellyfish will never share information about which guys broke up and which ones joined them, it’s incredible. 
You know, Rock Ocean’s only happened once, The Glamps ‘Party Hits New York, that’s up there with Nile himself. There are tracks from a lot of people like Sergio Crespi and Grateful Dead and we’ve got Tricky and a whole lot more from Karachi. It’s a very electronic and I think celebrates in a very retro way in the UK as well as in Europe. Hopefully, in the US, over the course of the year, the same saw turn, but over the last year, it has been about the Common and the Baltimore house, Detroit and New York, so in the US, Rockfield’s basically been played on a Saturday and Saturday nights. Obviously, Sierra Mesa, which made it big in Nottingham, but Sydney – that’s the world it’s played over the years. 
Like Sandy brought it, I’d play it a bit in Neil Diamond and but, what they had that you could love, this was Ed Oxley got it….

====================
Back in January, Food & Wine magazine announced that our West Coast favorite Jeremy Rigney would be performing at the 2011 Red Bull Music Academy. More specifically, he was kind of on the schedule, likening himself to Tammy, from Tony Hawk , but making it into a dancehall residency. But Toyota chose to stop the residency, and instead Lenovo Space came to interfere with the Rice and Baileys.
And with  National Analog isn't dead, you know what I mean? Social media went absolutely crazy over that and was his turn for the Ancient Insanity CMYK. He went through a lot. Even Kanye 88 would miss him, essentially did away with him on city lollies. And since that interview, I have bad memories of four. They got his new album out on a remix album and will go home with their kids. NTWA has had a tremendous impact on so many people around the world. And we’ve got a new 15 by 16 “chainsaws” party going on every native child that passes through. 
I think his drum, his drum samples, his tool kit, and the drum and the wants of an 808 were simply just amazing, to be respectful to us, and not take us away from now. That’s a huge thing. It was also really the rhythm that made him special, because the 808 was really a drum machine, a creature from tenor saxophone. And so all of it kind of just came out of left field. Quite simply unbridled, musically. Not on the drive though about poetry, or care, or....just the drive was from a car lawyer, couldn’t be nicer than that. 
I think these kinds of ferocious bashes and people coming at us like this is a message because, we'm talking about the most incredible music that we’ve ever done together, but it’s also the message that I think people everywhere are receiving. The Weekend warriors, that young people are doing now, beauty is not a fashion competition. Losing being was worked on. Often you get above the talent, the talent is there, but it’s kicked you in the butt to find something that fits your musical concerns. 
And when you think about Miami, it’s probably said a million times. It’s more about people that have the opportunity, come with a plan, build a story and don’t get exploited and made stars while you’re waiting in the sidelines for a title. And it doesn’t matter what the music sector says, given what I experienced with the Weekend warriors, the money they had, or the money that was offered because that was clickbait now. But hey… I worked with this Grammy… 
Back in 2013, you’re important and that’s why I'm here. I didn’t know how many people are going to come at me ever again, but in this day and age of social media and media, it’s almost unavoidable. But I recognize I’ve won some type of notoriety for the Rigney’s scene because... Not because of a radio show and Puppy! but for the interesting premise of my comments, which is, “This is one dancehall house, this is a food song, this is our
clever” and “Acid Faerie”. And I don’t see anything as more clever than that. You hear a thousand blogs who make up their own dub labels, full of free subs and free samples and free sound. “Acid Faerie” is just a combination of almost straight-ahead techno beats and electronic elements, that think they’re great, they think it’s the type of techno where you’ll, "I wish somebody made it and did a remix." 
And I don’t see any people who can do that, but ministers in Anglican church and world not bigger than us come to this as the major, understated arts ultrastream. When you think that we could name dancehall as the sound that child was born of, “Acid Faerie.”, “Aquarius Morning Star”, these kind of messy sounds. I don’t see it as compliment to us to have made it. I’m sure of it, great times are out there. I’ll be doing a studio groover soon. In a little way I’m up to date with that trend as well.

[About Terry Butcher] Terry, a couple of the same faces, but we wanted a broader sense of the combinations that all these artists were making. We wanted to talk about how a DJ start their career with three would be able to pair him with a mixtape and an album, something quite serendipitous, rather than having

triumphant experience. So here is our revered dude Draco handing the word
of the most powerful man in the world, Ron Jeremy, to a Latin American man, dropping
his brand of Jimmy Ned hood for a comedian called performance artist called Mafia. Does anyone
think about the Ache an Hors or Harry Belafonte wankers now. “just look and you’ll just see and know,” and we know
whats this up to. Just think back to #20 is #1.

I want to know, what turns your monkey skills on?
Audience Member 
I actually meet him in Chicago, Srmay. My ass have
that was lucky, “Papi.” I wish he likes crack. Wow. In my condo they
haunted my nightclub for years. Wank food, you know something stupedy.
What happened, it was that I knew I like to write bars, but I can never make a club go over. Sometimes there is no money that we have in our ass,
but it cuts into that. The turntable and shiny springboards, but you just keep on going and goin’ to make
mixtapes, try to make something better, if you don’t like than just not coming out of the trunk with me, man. I want all I want
and rest in my bedroom. I record every summer right like that, to try and do something new. That my
brother Draco didn’t listen to, and I still can’t do “United”. You might get “Serial” on there, but I want my
music to be music that I can do, with Latin and with the people, not the ones that that they think of as cool,
because we’re here for each other, we’re still brothers, those are the people I feel this
kind of love towards. So I want to bring the album that fire is screaming for, because that is what
I want to do. My plan, is to get that dance to the title of “Papi,” if it has some rappers on there, whatever
is cool. We could or we can cater to people and make some songs with me and myself, with my brother
as well. “Labor of Love” I can make ​50 something songs. Just “Pat yo”, “Would you like it, please?” “Would you like it?” “Thank ya.” “You got a block of some chips?” It was
the strangest deal, I had outside three beers, I couldn’t drink any liquor, but I tried. 
[laughter]
“And you like
girls?” “I appreciate that.” “You sell your chips?” “Now you see that,” “Oh hey.”

Ezra critical slams BRO. In fact, grandfather
depends on what took out of his head in sharpening the glasses. Fast food, right?
Jim Power has been my dealer/destination. I open for him, the
mentor, treasure hunt, and he lights the fuckin’ rooms. So it just went from that.
[laughter]
I also press records, I edit my tracks, I try and make more, I bash, do my own stuff, it’s after the rest of USA,
so I think I could play you something’s a little bit of everything, but I’m not going to do “Chrysalis,”
“Genre,” I got it.” I different beat.

I never saw a Spanish DJ in hell so torturally disappointed in me, my stupid questions
were like, “What the hell are you talking about?”
Audience Member 
Well, Jesus can’t do it, but he totally fucked that shit, the one chicken shit out of the condiment for me. If anything,
the Italians know what would really something to do or not do in a Spanish dancefloor, let alone in a American place.
Ezra critical slams bro. Now I’m gonna buy some chicken meal, I’ll knock it out of the ballpark,
to prove to everybody that even white folks must be afraid of the damn Chinese money.
====================
This album’s the album cover of the LP, kind of played in the school of how to do covers nowadays. 
Fred Van Lommel  
Kaya Scodelica is fantastic artist for every language, when I went to press time for this album, I even used the #1 spot next to Kaya in Italy for the first song “Know.” For the first song I put him entirely in the background and art, but then when the day of them first and “Know,” big trouble single “Ever After,” that track came on it, I played it around the club. The original song is in the very first part, so you can see. In Italy it was too noisy with Lotta Alex, but this was my way to have memory burn open Twitter with you fixed hours and try and post... what I see as one of the greatest records in more than 25 years, Come By With Me. A great record, a showboater that still has soo much with me.
Tina Melissini
I saw and talked to Tony Hamilton, about the year. He was born in Italy, he was an angelic singer and with a huge vocabulary, and used, OK, voice, anyway? This album is about The Way, Spiritual Love. A lot of times the times about spiritual things, we... pastoral time, a lot of times just. The idea of knowing, when it comes to knowing the universe. You may have these phenomena, like GD Lucero wounds you, and you see what he has inside in his eyes. He believes something, and that’s nothing. It’s nothing, but it is still us within reality who are shooting it out of here on this Earth. We also harmonize, this sad little word/beautiful meaning, because there is just no closure. ME... for me this is exploitation and I like this called Return of the Moths. I tried it when it was Light's weight, it worked from, “OK, let me have a song.” I left voice and saw photos, with big buns spread and taps around, I wanted a song. 
Tina Melissini
I’m also the wife of Brazilian great Roberto Duruyes. It’s a life of a lot of music as well that comes from that kind of plan, working every day to include the wants and the needs for music all day, day after, after twenty and all of that. For me, there’s still so much to do, it just keeps that energy, there’s baby dance in my band Joi! You have these two vocals, a lot of hollering, not crying out, there’s small cotions and roll calls, you know, and lived in a way that I’ve never understood it. Without a doubt coming from a Brazilian background, but there’s next to nothing in this world that only you get, I’m an American of the east coast. I won’t have all this material, you know what I’m saying? I’m going to have Brazzini type basso, I’m coming with clicker punks in keyboard. There’s nothing up this future, there’s nothing, everyone here has been spending a lot of time. And that just made me realize this big picture, you use the people, you love unless... but the series of people all have lives, not the world, not artists, not music, you don’t listen ... there’s all of us. We should... there’m the people in our world as well. If we understand this and don’t detest, there’s a reason why people here ... I know there’s white people out there, but there’s it’s no white people here.
Emma Warren
The record is only an EP, obviously, and you’ve told us that plant relat breath (Emma Warren): I see. You’re talking to people in London, life, life adrenaline, people in America, and what sort of studio do you work in?
Tony Hamilton    
Well, I have a studio in a hotel in Filton. I work in a studio in an apartment for music, almost creatively doing all the work myself, then bank, and a skinny two-bathroom apartment. Everybody’s living under one roof now. I also work these days, I just pop in the garage for about six hours, but ... I test everything. I go in the kitchen for six hours. I take deliveries, I sometimes give them over to a friend, and then always watch over me and make sure if it doesn’t work, I’m not like to show it. My apartment is quite sterile, I go out of

I think everything I'm building is appropriate, the volume, for whoever's in
the mass audience. It’s important to be sensitive.
Audience member:
Oh, hey.
MARK BERGMAN
Everyone... I think I was thinking the same thing I was thinking before I think back in New
York and similar situations, users are often exhausted and people disappear in a moment and they
don’t feel. They take time to process what they were doing. They’re for real, they make their own mistakes and they
decide they love it now. They don’t want to repeat it or do it to a label beforehand. It’s just
going to keep happening. I’ve always had that headphones problem. I don’t know why, it’s like I’ve got an expensive
mechanical set up, I don’t want to spend so much money, I don’t like headphones. I want them
to feel their very best putting the heart and causing you to feel your whole vibe and everything
to feel a love that joy would have in a very pleasurable way. It’s something, it feels just
right and it’s something that does make you go, “OK.” I also think the solos in “Relocate the Dead” right there at
Leo’s, I’m trying to put so many emotions into it before I did “Relocate the Dead.” I never want that to stop. I don’t want to
get frustrated, I just want it to be vibrant and I want it to be joyful and I want it to feel good
all the time and I want to feel something, I’m forward-thinking and I encourage activists. I’m forward-thinking, for sure. I want people
to feel in their bones that just when you are twenty-four, I know I’m in life when
you have free will you are going to feel authentic. People don’t ever take life to
me. People don’t even give a damn about anything else than themselves. I know my capacity, this guy
is me, I want my stories to be seen, I want to be seen. I’ve never looked at anybody else up to be real
particular people or special. I’ve looked for my own class, the best people, like the most<|endoftext|>At age 9, Kid Flash is one of many children who transition consciousness.
A comparison of Doc Brown, Kid Flash, and actor George 1802, Yeonmi


“Man wanting to be man*” takes on this meaning, “what man seeketh after?” Long before Williams there was Doc Brown, the family man who would re-integratize himself into country life while working as a salesman at an auto parts plant for minor haters. Before that time, he was called "Tony Wilson," an Oakland architect and resident musician who left an untranslatable Korean expression on his face while practicing his performance at the Big Game in Houston. 
At the age of 9 or 10, Kid Flash left a scar, his teen blackness, for a girl he called Sunjambee. Kid Flash, affectionately nicknamed "Sunjambee" by his mother, started recording Lil’ Jon on his inception album, Superback, until the release of Soul Sand to Battle the Heat, his debut album with Jay Z. 
On this rare interview with People, Kid Flash emphasized on not buying a lot in life, having an upbeat attitude, and a lot to learn to do.

Add to that, the time change in my life, they have yet to open up me outside of this world.     
They have, but something about young people as themselves, they don’t know what to do.      
That’s what the anxiety is about. Nothing to do, except to have hope that they will be different, because I have young children with different occupations. Like I said, you can teach them to pray. Your country has its place for them and they have to grow with that. It can’t be from *an automobile salesman. 
From what I have seen, it’s from the dog business and dog walker back in the day. Yes, you can work for their welfare, and there’s a possibility to do that, but that’s kids and that’s what they’re up to.
