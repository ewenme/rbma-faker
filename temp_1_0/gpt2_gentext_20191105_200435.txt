I Used To
Get Razzmatazz”)


Singer Richie Hawtin
is no stranger to MGM and acts like Adventurers – don’t take that as me assuming that he alone is a notable engineer. From All Stars to He-Man, as well as appearing on numerous American creators ’s albums including Spring Jam and Flying Dutchman. Yet in essence, we’ll say that he is almost the embodiment of the sounds that are both sonic two way radio, for human, and classic disco beats, transforming sounds into what we consider dancehall. Despite all of this, listening to his songs is still the most captivating discovery when one hears it and the nuances of his composition. In West, Ohio, called the Futsal Palace, a legendary number one Miami house DJ called Richard Beaumont, had the opportunity to toss a dream to an aspiring producer with his debut single, Imagine.

In the video below, Richard Beaumont gathers with his young producer named Richie as inventively introducing rock Egyptian lyrics and New York soul influences during a homemade record. The long procession of Jarvis Cocker, Kimberly Allen, Shane MacGowan, Chop Suey, Juelz Santana and Richie Hawtin – in the studio each night the duo recorded like a dozen records, from weeks of play Joni Mitchell and Jam Master Jay before running off to lunch and funcapes – are the silhouettes here.

Some of the records on this showcase are Juelz Santana, the Armor, James Brown and even Ricky Martin, they simply caught our ear right away. Of course, there are other American artists such as Sam Smith, The Hot Jam, and as Daz Dillinger are even here to introduce, the Doggy Beats, one minute you hear Bobby Darin coming up, the next you hear James Brown. The sound nastiness remains eloquent, however.

Then there’s Régine, a rapper famous in England for the 1998 single “Iced Tea.” A blazing red guy I wanted to smash that whole dulcet dubstep production with him. He wanted rid the dubplates loud before the dub...
David Nerattini 
I think those productions were legitimate, what happened with that is anybody can make a dubstep record. Some of the records were sub-standard. But in the midst of all that was a record from Wakin on Top labelled “Just Get Used To It.” It became as good as “Wake Me Up.” They had even a dubstep remix called the dubstep Christian EP. I had that EP. I was in Megadeth before that because we were a teenager when we were released and I didn’t wanna play them. I wanted to take them ․Wake Me Up” and the Germans released it. (music: Sterling & Sterling – “Just Get Used To It” / applause) 
With that I have to ... In ‘93, ‘94, I got a lot of success around the world from Latin dubstep. Back in New York, I was talking with Ariel Rech, who had released his records as Roxy Music. I had found them on Technics Synclavier. I was using electronic drum machines, Technics Synclavier. Herbie Jackson, who released his records on Zay & Rick Ross” did there dubstep record. With that record, the record was called First Earth Dub. Ariel produced “First Earth Dub”
David Nerattini 
In my experience it worked out. After all, we were all your typical New York producers. You would pull out a record, you’d knock a dubstep record out, it was a basic remix. A record for the sub-mer, and then you would shout about dubstep or Japanese dubstep or disco and people would love your creation even if they weren’t listening to dubstep or analogue or whatever. You had a few records released. And never before had I listened to dubstep so much so I had this record and another record by J Dilla, “Black Widow” by James Joe, which was always featured on this record. J Dilla was a junior jazz producer in New York. And he, a producer, already had the pedigree of a great dubstep producer like Jimmy Jam. “Fancy N Latiner,” which was actually another dubstep record, was never actually released. If you haven’t listened to dubstep, you need to, “Please come to the club. We need to do it.” It just works to have tracks that are out there that are... It just works out for the record label because they take care of you or the release of records. But the main thing is to be true to your material and don’t have a lot of... You know you can make a dubstep record. You’ll go up to 100,000, 110,000, eventually 120,000, it just gets to your head that that’s a lot, really. “Ah..” You’ve gotta look at it that way. 
And you have the technology and you know they’re talking a lot about. Come to some other sound and just try to put a sound on the dancefloor, instead of trying to be like, “I played some tunes,” and just try playing a copy of something, it isn’t going to work. It’s not going to go out. When you have it is all really, really, to believe in your own talent, in your own ideas, and it really is. There’s nowhere else you can go. “I had it, come to the club.” One record released, another record dropped, I had control for doing it. Heatman Dubstep, “If Da Trill Is Alright” was released on the world label, MSP, and they were proud of me, and they got a big world system. I’ve got two records out and I’ve got a remix record as well. I’ve got another record out. Everything just works out in the end. There’s no planning. 
No more accounting. The only time it’s a job to have the dollars is when you’re on your on your own. You don’t care how long ago
====================
commercial records and rock-oriented records
had left, they’re gonna change as or as a segment in what was being done. ‘Cause again, they’re gonna get very involved in rock music,
away from the people who are doing things and they’re doing something that's also. Totally the
thing that used to be out there, is that they came into the band and they’d be asking for
prokkas and funk records, not with the music that they had. They would be going with
the songs. They never thought they would just build a new catalog and have ‘em on the album and no one would - no radio
programming for nobody would play anything over those tracks. So, for seven years, they were able to just run every time a new album came out.
Now, we look at something, there was nothing with most of the  Soul Power stuff that we did. It had a lot of stuff on it. It had Robert Plant, It had T.O. wa-va-ta-ta, we had KP After Dark,
Marc Chase, that was a lot of the stuff. I think Dick Dale, Scott Storkel, Miles you remember them all. Every EP was different. Every single was there. It was a license that the label was giving. I knew the label did it, the art supervisor, Robin Herman, we had a licence at the time. That is the first Christmas album
of any kind. This was the biggest Christmas album by any label in history. Reality Org – POT, whatever they put it in – had the first Christmas album, um? What do you call it? • That’s how it started, when you got your records on POT you’d get a license, the record… and then, after that,
at the very end, they had the record ASCAP JU’s Record of the Day and the Chuck D album, and all the other labels started catching on. I remember POT was a vinyl revival label.

Jeff “Chairman” Mao 
We had the peeling off of Christmas records as well, when people tried to rip you off for that.
Kevin Shields 
I never even though, it was from the UK press and was directed at everybody. At the time, everybody had vinyl in their bedroom. They had headphones, headphones to listen to. Vinyl meant when something was in somebody’s head they would be able to listen to it. If you leaned down, you would be able to listen to your brother’s records. So, if somebody got you with an MPC and said, “Can I break that copy?” And if it came out on vinyl, if somebody could even buy it, then everybody would listen to it. It was great for a soundsystem and it gave people a passion for vinyl. Everybody went, “Can we put a label on it?” Because it was the thing that changed the whole Eastern/Southern roots of Soul Power. That’s when we got a first record off there from."”Bill Muldoon’s" The Devil Goes First, you started
getting the breakout records from the United States. As a matter of fact, that was POSS: March Of The Saints. When I got my first song off there, Floyd came to talk with Kevin. We would just go on the Internet, 'cause Kevin had already worked in Amsterdam. We would start talking to that artist, baria. The record had already title, guy had a Calvin Harris record. “You left my house tonight?” They had a hit record there. They had all the
hit records, it was the first hit record [of] all time. That song, “Just to
Get In The Mood.”
(music: POSS – “Merry Christmas Film Intro (Bill Muldoon Scorpio Remix)”)
Hamilton Electrics 
That’s one we have, we played live and did a show called Chill Out That’s gonna be a pretty big act. Three of these artists was doing what we only had access to do in the pits and in the underground as well. Not back then, but under the surface gets a lot more widespread. “Win, win, win, win, win, win.” We were doing five shows and our first was a club show. That track, we had– it was ‘92 or ‘91, I think and Freddie Falconer is kind of thinking that it’s fun. I Don’t Think They Reminis, that shit was freestyle writing. These cats already had the talent, it was open minded. I was living with them and doing shows with them all, and we had a family that were now about to go through the immigration system
====================
Joe’s [Leaving Station] Show is not coming to a plane at this time. If you’re lucky enough to be in an elevator when you leave for work and you’re handling the logistics of hi-fi and machine storage, yes, your most important consideration is whether you want the disclaimer that the traditional radio station will ever play your radio show again. Some people feel that the gig will always give you the confidence to do that, and I’ve never had that feeling myself, but after releasing 350 songs or whatever it is, all being done on cassette, isn’t that important now? So I understand why people recall it. Anyway, as far as I understand, an elevator was originally taken out of tune for the 40-track format because it had failed 5 out of 5 times, but it does device them out and pick out the right songs to help us train the DJ in their system, so, actually, that’s the kind of thing that the DJ can really rely on the system right now. You’ll increasingly hear the reviewers of the format say, “Oh, yeah, so OK, 10 contracts, he lit's way an’six, but…” Then we’re scrambling. That’s the format that we see a lot of CD-Rs being pulled down from. The highest-rated form of distribution, in my opinion, is the 7 Play, which is vinyl in clear, because diamonds, people sometimes think that, like, the editors that I work with will tag the track and gold letters and stuff, but as soon as they push the speed and the EQ then a block of five plays is not just, “Ah, oh, this doesn’t have fat,” it’s like, “This is the lowest-quality vinyl sound, B-side, but go for it, you paid £100.” So, that stuff, at least .002 to 0.026, whatever, is where they want; maybe some live work by the lesbian dancers to get up the world will help a little more, but for everything it’s always relative. [laughter] This kid, he’s got the shit to put it: he grinds through snare hits. 'Cos they’ll get to the end and then, “Oh my god, you muck [presses some power button]” ... What does his job look like? It’s waiting for them until the likes of the Beastie Boys, Random Access Memories, Loud Jess [quickly shakes wad of Flava Frills], Keds, Lord Is Over Incredibly, Just Blaze, Dj Audio, these monsters leave. They’re grandstanders, and they know how to leave the money, they want to be forgiven and rewarded for the quality which is absolutely crucial. If they get through the second to the third, then it means what, because they got to the end.
I wanted to put it on release more slowly this time, because I came in thinking that this is the kind of music that should be being sampled here and sampled here and sampled there, and the beaming guys. And Lil Wayne, who’s also got this tapes that I can get his record and he’s always sampling out of interest and analyzing the beat so he can flip it at a second later. You know what I mean? All this stuff, still the best remakes of record. It’s all happening without a single controversy, [asked by audience member whether it’s always wrong to sign reseeds in the UK]. And it’s always, “Oh yeah —” Distortions in there, and they think I look only on tapes – even if as soon as say, I’d like to preserve some material, which [Isaac] calls a tragedy, “Tell Hands,” and all just Kauff and the Giusto, who’s cool,” so they will bring bout it. So they made the remix of Lord Is Over Incredibly, there’s no waffle at all.
Mark Ronson
It’s a long story, but this wasn’t just a snapshot, it was 14 tracks retouchaed, which a dude in Italy called Maxime pleads money for or he completely destroys the 70s. So, totally apocalyptic through-whisper. What does that show us as Western DJs that make it industry relevant again? Do we lose industry credibility? Do we lose the platform? Practice is important knowing what to do. A lot of DJ Grime got famous because of this – Mark Ronson most famously has been recording this for six years. Better a photographer I think than the visible sober social, especially here in my country, but finally, guys that everyone talks to. Dorian Fry, Ethan, Axwell? I
====================
Its output can be pretty amazing when combined with DSP, thing of the 30 years it has been playing at this point. 
“Really? How many tracks is that? I thought that was me.” 
“I thought it was me.” It’s for sure born from an Australian talent. 
“I thought you were from Australia.” It’s about having really good production equipment, and having a good mix on your equipment. 
Only Sky Acats, the Australian producer from the ’80s, Drexciya need do overin this crazy bridge performance, ’cause it’s just stunning to see where that connects into the studio experience. 
Now, if you have a connection to the other side, then you can do things with “Build In” and”Build Around
’cause they all exist in the same
group. 
When my first record was out, there was a little track called “Shoot the Bong” by The Skin. It was released on Wood Shoulder Records, a very commercially-oriented record company. It just looked great. 
Keiji Yamamoto
Right, yeah. So it’s been the reason why I’m doing this, I think that’s really good. 
Todd L. Burns
Yeah. 
Keiji Yamamoto
I’d say you get my music from that Drexciya soundtrack, which take people back to the classics … that’s really … I think about three years before my first record made it into a big record, a record normally swallowed by people, “Oh my God!” It was an amazing, best-selling record that became really big which is represented by Wood Shoulder Records. 
Todd L. Burns
That record, “Shoot the Bong,” was unmistakingly album, right? 
Keiji Yamamoto
Yeah. That was like the second record, the third artist said, “Yeah, let’s do something like this.” 
Audience member
Fascinated? 
Keiji Yamamoto
I mean, my first record, it’s all been in my head since about ’80s like New York Light was 25-years-ago, ’cause if you’re thirty years old you’re not like people where the first record was released to someone. You have to wait. And my one…
Audience member 
What was that about? 
Keiji Yamamoto
My first record, “The Naked People Stare,” made me [with only coffee in my mouth]. But a lot of people, because of that record, they keep asking for some version of my music out there like Kontuvmentaire [Electrico] or what’s your name, it won’t be possible. So I thought it’s better if people like to hear a version of your music, newspaper or something. 
Audience member 
Yeah, like the response to that record, the two editors at the Bottomfeeders asked me to do “Europa” an album and I thought, “Holy crap, anyone else?” 
Keiji Yamamoto
This record that then we released the first time certain people in LA were dancing. “Europa,” like young men, what the hell is European? People didn’t know. It was young men, that means yeah. 
(music: Keiji Yamamoto feat. Chip & Tim – “Europa” / applause) 
Alright! 
Keiji Yamamoto
This is… 
Albert Breer 
How long had it been? 
Keiji Yamamoto
Asia. It took me a while to get to this point, I was the last one to do a record, sadly. I got the tenuous connection between people with the idea of carbon punks, or in terms of the rating, parallel punks and people who also have… I cannot listen to this music. It’s not that I hate it, it’s that I always felt like things like orchestra don’t need to be played in front of them to make them something that’s cool, because if someone just turns a music clip into an orchestra, it’s not entertainment. 
Albert Breer 
I mean, everyone else. 
Keiji Yamamoto
China bday. But people say that on the local Indonesian record, records touching the factory floor, there’s a lot of talking, you see, in terms of older imagery and music. The Factory Labour Party hit Sydney at 2012, ’96. It was a political song. And the Radiohead record “Wonderwall
====================
“Hey Freddie, I wanna...” here, here, boom, million times
here, boom, boom, boom, boom. He was just rabid, like you said, while
driving to work, flying to work, all this stuff was so crazy, so
crazy. 
Todd L. Burns 
Let's just move on to something that had a force, like Whitey Riddick and that collection of records.
Just listen to Martavis Scott, Pt. 2, “I Don’t Love Wine,” Maestro Mason, that was an important one for funk in big places. There a couple of Motown records on that label that I
supposed were harder, that I wasn’t missing with we heard them online on the radio,
when there was this Midwest ska-based outfit called the Seven Pretenders. I actually heard
a Stevie Wonder song in my living room the other day, play it like seven times in a row. You
need this to get it, there’s no Gulf Co. Cream pie numbers, but you owe in ’94. Fashion hundred won’t
refuse to hook you with this stuff, that wasn’t part of guitar band great, a samba group, big
hit. That was a great one, but a lot of older records I’d sold years later, they’d be out
selling those records. Majestic. They just bought turntables and put them into record collections, which were bigger still in ’93
and ’94, anyway. I think for some reason we’re always on the edge of the clouds, so we’ve
lost sight of the fact that when we're talking about illegal language that we talk about and we
go to talk about, why we’re partying with an AC rehabilitanned person at some point and you have
work operations on the roads, why aren’t you joking on a road? I mean, it’s there came a time
where people was losing their jobs. Other than that, I don’t know. 
Todd L. Burns 
What is it about Motown that appealed to you. I mean, if you look at a lot of different
materials, I feel like their compilation has something very special to it. 
Julian Beret-Lieber 
Todd L. Burns 
What was your favorite song from Motown? 
Merle Haggard 
There was a song on Motown, one of their famous songs, that was called “How You Remind Me”. It was on a
squad called the Miracle High School. It was their very first single, ‘Moon Blues.” I just remember the
birth of a child, and you got Beat Second Buddah here. The whole story with that is that
the murder rate in Baltimore spiked, baby boomers grew up around the area. It was a weird time for everybody, and things just kept getting better and better and better. Everybody was in their bars, and there was always something to do there. Motown wasn’t always good out there, but I always loved that record, because I wanted to share this one with others and say, “Look, you’ve got the faith in me you know what I’ll say to you about that song’s really fucked up though,” but at the same time you’ve got Motown, there’s nothing else around. 
Todd L. Burns 
You mentioned Memphis before, but you had some West Coast influences in your record. What was that song
that you thought was the Kardash <Miss Pussycat>?‎ 
Julian Beret-Lieber 
There’s another record that I thought was the best song on the record was one I saw on a Zanzibar album years ago. They
tie it back to a couple groups, the Tripin' Out”. There’s another track from that record, there’s another record from West
Coast that you can go back to. 
Some other stuff…
Todd L. Burns 
You said that when drums started to really break down, that it was hard to get the elements. How did you go about making it
the way you wanted it to be? 
Julian Beret-Lieber
That I would play them voodoo records with like three minutes or something, and Plumb Stuff would play a ​thing, “I’ll murder this baby, kill this young man.” It was easy for us, I just played it, and it worked. In a few years that was it, we really got that Village Sound back, right? 
Todd L. Burns

The other thing is the themes of our radio show have been around for both years and
times. Madonna is another example. Recently, there was a song on Evergreen and there’s Michael’s
album. Madonna is really bringing a message to “Apted Out.” Now Wine and Roses
is really driving that message up. All of us have this technology to connect and feel our back and the
light. I remember when Madonna first came to town, she came to the Wynwood Radio studio
and made record that just screams back to me – said, “In the morning, on the show
front, I’m
out of breath listening for you, you’re the little down of the world…” When she
comes to New Orleans. 
[Mexican-Jazz / California] 
That stuff just kept rolling and rolling. Guys like Bobby Otis and DJ Ace
Young – nobody said song
was going to break, if you hear anything good. None of this reggae we’d been hearing over
the years. When Madonna came to New York on tour she said to me, “I knew you’d… might
like this record because it’s a touch, and I’m not going to let you in the way so
they can't hear out of ear pieces of a record.”

[This record was so a touch that when she comes to New York music she likes to go to our studio, stuff like this, we put in a lot of
breakbeat machines. To be completely honest with you, things like this were just
in the early ‘80s. They were just breaking beats at that point. A lot of times we just put them together on drums, in solid state
records. Just weird built-in groove with two or three sweeps going together. But what is important, when you listen to this record
is when it breaks on a breakbeat… you almost see this sweetness, this ©, and it
lacks it. It’s kind of rushed and it’s just fugly.

The Atlanta People of Restong Music Hall became . This is the real Atlanta Hip Hop stadium in New Orleans. A lot of people are not aware that people come from out of the city, and its always been Atlanta hip infused hip hop experiences, here’s cool people, there’s interesting artists here and it’s a record festival and a dancing house, and they have acoustic instruments and they make their records as well. Nobody knows where the people in Atlanta are from, they’ve seen them. It feels very Georgia R&B, with no agenda, when we were chilling on the balcony at Club 333, Dr. Dre was on Dr. Dre parka and you saw Snoop Dogg with an acoustic cane, there had to be 11-trackers and he can run at 30. All those guys, everyone got drugs on the street . You know, they was juicing, everything was happening on time, when the track was ready in the studio and then were four minutes pros at Blockbuster. All of a sudden you’d see a gangbang, when it came time for the concert. Kendrick Lamar would come, I wasn’t there, Kendrick Lamar would lead the funk group in the busiest event in the history of music, and we just all danced in the same direction. 
A lot of times you like to listen to Blockbuster, and the crowd, “Get on the Ballot, Outta Atlanta! Outta Atlanta!” Now this one song was on and our guest was Snoop Dogg, he had the 25th Anniversary CD, he was there whenever His Highness would come out. I remember Snoop’s first night at Club 5 was on. It was going down! That’s the biggest shit being played in these clubs.
NERMEEN SHAIKH 
What was your gig up to on that night?
JODY MOBLEY 
Famsel was here to see how this man named Dre was coming back, and while we’re there The Great Hip Hop Bill was... Snoop can shoot every drop, and there was lots of dogs, but there were also so many Atlanta kids in the crowd, it was like Atlanta proper. It was the Wild 99 kind of Hawks fans. Like outside of The Great Hip Hop Bill was our drummer, he’s a young man in his twenties, and he’s of Puerto Rican heritage, but he got the like addiction for basketball and he got behind the desk for everybody. Maybe five minutes is the time to speak and the guy when he walks in, he’s got some smoke and fags, “That light thing, that baby
that just blew the sightlines out of the cold water.” “Hey man, Where ya gonna place that light thing gettin' Narcan on down?” He had such mellow energy, and I don’t know if I musically know one of the most thug-a-bruise rappers. There was so much music on that night, and that’s just the spirit that brought this people down and inspired such a crowd, who you might not be in the same vicinity, but the people that we was hearing of was always inspiring them, and I love music that’s raw and wild, that is astonishing.
Yeah, there was in the club room, we had a lot of players. We had Dabrye Pearl, Common, Skream, G-Unit, all the old school ATL Crew. There was I Don White, the manager from Divisions, Bad Attie, NWA two-time Big Dogg Raw was there, and we had groups like Q-Tip, Drs. Dre, and Kendrick Lamar. You know what I mean this is very Atlanta-y. There was there were people like Jazzy Jeff, he was out there with Big D and nothing else, D-Waves could be up to 30 or 40 points and cut their dance or lean, and I would lean back and watch, and when they would end up using Punali Outlow that it was dub hearing.

audio changed if you want to use this song in a DJ set. 
I would love to say that Twinks had the best vocal line ever when he samples that broken Swiss machine he has in his bag of recorded tunes, but you can hear him snicker as the song changes to “Hold On 24/7”. That’s all. That was perfect! Also, I’m impressed with DJs such as MCOM, Tek Taylor, Todd Glove, Gaudi Schlechter, Kimper Wessel and Tim Rogers II that were not only capable with the samples that French DJ Pierre Lavon, Rasheed, Akinyele 7120 and Babs Brown had made — but they quietly take every sample without fanfare. Every little thing has a signature. Besides that, the samples are butchered … ," Christophe Appert is a rouge French DJ who does sure to have fit the French style for who is up there. The whole percussion idea was dope. There’s nothing and it’s so cutting, dirty, disgusting.

Yes, thank you so much! Thank you. Do the music you like, even if you don’t want it, you can try to make it here, because it’s already here. Don’t write off this music you don’t want, because it’s already here. We don’t have no cards to absorb or they don’t have cards to read. I mean, my record company can do that. I’m ready to go. We’re already talking about the CD. I say can’t buy it – long story. We won’t sell the music here so much yet. Okay, I’m happy like that, very happy. Do it with your friends and those cards. Pat, still … You know, there’s somebody that was here.

Yeah, we’ve heard a certain record before on this program, but it’s too much disco past, and it’s not enough. So it’s like, “No, the censorship is unfair, you know?” You know what I’m doing, I’m not like, you know? Like, yeah, we’ll shut it down. I’m why I used to make records. Giving you in part of my money. If you record here, put it out here for Paris, and listen to it to Paris, to France, and whatever I want to do, I’ll be OK with it. I’ve found that free. If you’re trying to record here with us here, you can try. I mean, getting my French language and everything we made on our EP, we did it in our majors, Standard Record, Lamba Band, Vox, Ace, British Big Band. We always used to use 32-track cassettes, and 24-track cassettes. We weren’t using made-in-China cards, you know? We never used American cards. Also, when we put Bends III – and I’m gonna drive you crazy for thinking the kitsch kind of again 6 foot-slim MC-50 tracks, and now the MC-50 is going mainstream. But we’re not going mainstream like that. Even outside the MC-50 is doing all these things. Cut to crispy, with spicy notes and the Australian problem still, don’t you think.

My mother was a… He was like … He was the one that we turn to as an expert once we reveal at the shop and in the end, of all the mistakes, my mother heals my attention. He was also a DJ, too. 8 And Louie Vega is a very big musical, another big DJ compared us to the hard likes of Vince, Future, Kerry West would offer, just kill it for people like Jerry if you would like to hear his music. But if they would like to see you, listen to this. Too tired, I’d rather see him shoot the snaps and card my eyes, so when something catches my eye, he’ll sing my name and stay with you then.

Hi! My name is Mia Liddiard. I started at Village. I made the world’s first psychedelic house party in 1986. To this day I am looking at how I contributed to an unknown exotic renaissance in cage music in my style of partying. I think through this time my commitment was to a much greater cause as an entomologist—or as ideas cannot die. I think, if I’d have seen Rough Trade then, no reason why you taken my toothpaste, maybe you just dreamed up this idea. Yeah… there is a reputation, I think, that you had on this level, but you serve you, and there was a reputation that with music was supposed to be some secret double identity. OK? There’s advertising in Rolling Stone, I think on homeless, homeless outreach which was to try and
suggest that the people with funds, and then by the way, if you post that for a Phillip Island Country girl, well, just wake up the girl! That child. It’s a classic advertisement of what is supposed to be poverty. OK? People are in their 22 years or something, they don’t expect to be homeless, and if they know you, you that can’t help. You know after the first Hip-Hop hit, there was money coming out of people wanting to have a good good time and where to go, what kind of things you can do with your money. I remember it was a couple of radio commercials where they went to the Taft area and they had this tent was behind a couple of chief. Fatman.

Mike …*Ma Cheng-Hoo?* .
MA CHENG -**- He was the director with another party, Samba Casino, and was quite an originator of all human movement as a converter. His involvement with white supremacy was to insulate Native Americans, and to groom their kids to be fully loyal slave tamper police. No other American was privy to this culture and indigenous people. It was called a chattel station. This is the one part of music that is trusted all of Point Mugu. Yeah, there is bands now coming to Central Florida via Miami, through the North Carolina… But back then, his signature was on post cards of an indigenous people and being Uncle Sam and shooting money or speaking Spanish or something about, maybe Sun Ra or something of that kind. They were correctly… Michael Caprio, they’re on the job own up to something they did. How would you know? There’s no album or documentary to show. It was more of the dirty cocaine way. In the beginning, there was the Opie and Anthony Band, the early Cuban O.J. Simpson, they all had black blood on them and it was low-priced drugs—$10.000 for one bottle of black drugs. Then jazzrock artists like The Band, the Yardbirds and Deloris Harding, they’re given drugs and they get high, and if they don’t, they’re dead, and it’s the worst way of knowin’ anything. When they went into these houses, they felt slime or no slime, and they were filled with pain and they had all this, those people that they would eat if they’re not scared of food. I put it on cards, ’cause I didn’t eat gonna eat no screws either,; they’d run the food the wrong way, and in ’92 Walt Disney had established a first to get jewelry white European. He had a point away front, so you could see where they’d wear. But as I recalled back in my days I was also very familiar with things like I guess – Almost Midnight, Pittsburgh Steelers football team, so they wear white. They wear their

Travis Charles
Hello.
IamTravis
Hey.
Audience Member 
I wanted to say thank you once again for your honesty
and for sharing your love of music. Your dedication to it’s meaning can be explained only
by time. It’s many things, you have stuff in you, I have stuff in me, but we
have these things in common, the only thing that bloodlust is able to do is in order to survive your personhood by becoming famous. And if anything now, wildlife
versus wild, wildlife destroying wildlife. I like the feeling you feel up here right now. And the difference is, if you personally, are interested in this stuff, if there’s something that you know of which is conventional and traditional, at what part of the brain is that most fundamental? Is that the first fundamental you want to understand?

Bala, I tried to ban a lot of coffee, did you? 
Michael Rother 
Yeah, Me and Rye failed, and I think Bass Pro’s Super Junior were the ones that had to
ban coffee because they’re double-fisted. 
Bala Bopa 
And I know that’s not going to help the acid tests though, so do you want to
share a few thoughts from your day? All short-term memories. You need to consider that now which plant you choose, it’s time to get married. Actually, I’m in Africa and I’ve been to Kenya. The food is fantastic, the goats are just gorgeous, I just love the sheep. I love the cows. I love everything, except the drugs. Don’t drug addicts, don’t drug addicts. Don’t they have a better life than folks living in LA? And never would I give anything up to them, but from me, it was the pure innocence
of knowing nothing I can get by wrong, no friends, and no fame. Because before I became famous I wasn’t a Friday night, I wasn’t a girl that opened a coffee shop, I was changing bras, and I wasn’t offering in coffee to women because I was still on my house. I wasn’t very happy, but then you do earn your money and more, so I got something for Coca-Cola a La Vida Lucia. 
Torsten Schmidt

We were so hardworking, you can’t let a fringe act get to you. Don’t you have anything to gather from us, about the days of the young people going off to do their
twiddles? Or if you do, what was the ecosystem like in Maryland then?
Bala Bopa
Dwight Howard was famous, had a catalogue, was a famous music sample. He talks
almost about it, it was called “De Teneo,” he talks about it, and he had a hit record. And I think that they all know the famous lyrics, had that kind of late ’80s atmosphere. Going directly off the streets was just what it was back then, and coming up the street, that wasn’t getting hit and this was all the energy. It was Jungleland,” it was just taken away, and didn’t matter, just all I recognized at this point was: “Yo, this music is here.” I mean, it
was never big enough for me, but that was between those of us, back then it was just dope. I didn’t know where I was, but we were up here, we had little computers and no specialists, and so we just took it wild and tried to get it right. Now, I don’t really know where you’ve been but there was a time when I just knew that I would never be normal. I’m a man at heart, I just can’t allow other people to look at me like this or just take my shit, and then become on the all-powerful people’s bullshit. And as I got older, I became old enough, and people changed. Now, it’s time to let go and get married and have children, and if it’s gonna help with eating, or whatever, here’s something to protect me. 
Torsten Schmidt 
Can we have your idea of at what point did we come to the realization that this kind of counseling wasn’t enough to stop you from doing it? Because, I just want to change your perception and the way you

If you post one stop internet, maybe I'll drop you one or two tracks. You can usually find your possible date of an artist if you support and they are on the Beatport Beat, it works like that for us.
I think there’ll probably be one by Wild Team Don, but it’s like a holiday for now, is like Labour Day, we’re a holiday and we’ll come back next year. But we’ll end up like on those releases.
Tiga
The first release we did was 100”s. You can do that sort of thing, but at this stage it’s more always rather quickly and a lot of effort and I don’t want to spend anything really crazy or overpopulated because there’s years that came out but that’s it. It’s interesting because it kind of works out that we all work with some rhythm and a tempo set and for a long time outside on the release, which… Is a really important point and a valuable thing how people can experience the art and how it affects the people that are listening. Because I think obviously the rhythm and the way we have to shape people's emotion right comes with the bassline and the snare, not just the top end, the whole… Is encouraging the rhythm and the snare. But I think we have to try and… My great, if I could speak now.
Wild Team Don    
Hey, I asked… I asked you before that. At this point, I think that it’s a very, in a way I… I don't know. It’s … If you know that, then, you should stop searching for this shit and focus on your own life, your own little plans and your own projects, because that’s what they go into and it’s so important. One site in many years. For me, it’s also a very important advice … Not to let music influence you is because if you want… If you don’t feel confident and feel like you can do something different you don’t want this reaction. It’s hard because you don’t have the pressure. Though most people do apparently feel accepted. We have risk-averse people too but you still don’t have. We create. It’s very, very frustrating. So I’m not very sure people should set a curfew, though… I’wanted it to be clear that the more you do on an album, the circumstances to where you come from, realize that you will be in later stages what it is… Is for the other person. It might see something in a club to have bands, put a song on that you? You don’t play around in front of, I don’t know. What does it seem like to you when your voice is given to other people. Leave your foundation in music and that’s fine either way, but it’s about the listener’s perception and the play and all of that? It’s a very difficult thing. Prince was like a producer when he was young, which was really something to do. At the night. You don’t want nothing to be probably too close, all of that doesn’t look good on your face. We’re going to see what we do and how it works out. You want people to know something and hit you in the face. You know, if you don’t want the people to know what you’re doing and what you’re up to, you’re going to hit them it right.   
When I did this stuff, I did it after months and months of listening, grinding and work, months and months and months. I think people who don’t... feel like they can do things completely different, too, and don’t really know who it is, hold them back and do things they don’t know, take that and blast away. Some people have a track in the hand and it doesn’t sound like anything they’d done before or the person discovering that track. If we put it in front of somebody and if they’re going to listen, that’s okay, we’re making music.

====================
Hey, “you” is our default shorthand for people who feel there’s something a privacy fetishizes in you, “it doesn’t matter if and how much we be used to] listening to hard-edged techno and Autechre breaks and teenage girl pop music, using it as a promo is just making you a person to be used by other people, because you know it’s just like what you see in the streets or on YouTube. It’s not their glut of the intelligence, which you’re supposed to want to be excited about. We listen to a self-identified extremist, hold a knife to their heads and dance to hooks, whoop, voices and strange images.
You know, the chains are tricky in these parodies. The idea is that some comedian should come up with the most politically incorrect statement they’ll ever say, which is that this is some kind of re-making of stuff, some feels and minds, and some shit. Nothing more than that. Definitely psychedelic. Lots of music really. Please don’t be offended by it that you look at it like that. We listen to everything we believe in and hope it will rub off on you. This is not a rebellion or it really is, it’s a love. We do good work by anyone and anyone’s listening to it will experience that and see that for the fun of it anyway, or if the voice keeps repeating, this likes to answer for somebody’s voice, which is yes, “it’s not bad.” Sometimes the voices you hear aren’t there or do they? Nobody’s completely hypersensitive to that. So just keep being yourself. It’s that simple.

and we only got a small taste, if there’s really no need to salute Deodato. In his piece op o Now, Now,
and age, Deodato picked all the bad bits and ran with them, but still, it’s so brutal. I want to ask you, if you at any age in the future allow your mother to inflict this kind of treatment, will you still support them, if you don’t want to be treated that way?
Michael Wasser 
Who’s my mother? I’m not commenting on your Facebook as if I’m asking, it’s one of my friends who said, “I know and he’s into my music,” and all the other stuff. I could, and mostly I’m toxic to people who don’t want to be emotionally touched.
It’s just, yeah. You get the point though, even if its something of more nocturnal variety. Maybe someone with a temper or a problem, anything’s possible. Actually, I think, you’re right in your end of it, in that’s how I feel about it. But I like to think it’s trying to make me pass, though to be honest, it’s trying to make me feel... I sometimes wish this kind of music were some other people’s music, that being said, it’s nevertheless what is 'good, it’s critical, if is that you have something like this that other people will actually enjoy and see, so then I can keep keeping my shit together.
I don’t say you should be emotionally taken advantage of and manipulated or stuff like that, because it doesn’t. Especially in this climate where the misogyny in this world, don’t people, on 11/11, can be directly analyzed to see how many people in there are who can commit [imitating spray of angry baby dollers]. We’re really cheap here and feel sad just when we’re feeling that way, I want to have something that sounds good, gives me energy is something I can lean into. It’s much better to be in this relatively romantic world right now than to be in this childish world.
I mean, that has to because I feel really pathetic when I miss something. This is really getting pretty old, really fast, I’m bored. I like to think of things, but that’s it.

childhood soundsystem. 
[laughter]
Davide Bortot 
Thank you. 
Torsten Schmidt 
You mentioned that there were so many different kinds of musicians you grew up listening to in your childhood
sounds.
Dillon Francis 
I did. We were well in shape and the wrong mind controls allowed too many
suggestions. If you wanted to hear one thing, you had to grow up with the rock interpreters like New
York or London. We did drugs, it’s some crazy trip, don’t you never hear that, let’s listen to a
thing twice. We’re locked in shit for stealing and records. It’s the 10:30 machine, you know, go to anywhere
and get the DJ on, some house sounds from New York, Baltimore, Newark, Washington. There’s no time, you know? We’re twelve, 13. We look at the clock, we want to be working on stuff. One of them missed the crunch... It’s way too early for that. We added pedal steel samples, pedal steel to the five o’clock spot. Its crazy. All this stuff that we’re playing in grind house and boom bap on the hard 120s, kick, snare, bass and hi-hat. Yeah, there was a percussion room, a guitar room, some tenor.... I’m repeating keys to the complete rock background and the guitar and whatnot. I thought based on what they were doing, they might sound silly, becuase It’s street parties. We’re talking all different ways that’s a different world.
Torsten Schmidt
Right, it is now for listeners to find it out where they met, even though appearance or whatever surrounds you. You talk about the New York’s old Renaissance School of electronic music from "Denver Savages" and Polovik, who, listen to them, individually are very different to the age, size and talent that we’re talking about in these London productions.
Dillon Francis 
Yeah, we live in a world of, you know, we’re talking about picking a bandwagon right now. The best thing to ever do in music was to grow up listening to old records. Don’t be scared to listen to all things we love. It really is all around you when you’re a teenager or -- in some cases -- when you’re an adult, remember that you’re a young man. Because there’s no limit, the things you’ll experience are pure psychedelia, whether its in cool bars or whatever. It’s just happenin’. Plus, we still like music we’ve reissued and sold what’s got for a long time, Throbbing Gristle reissued their records in this central location, where it’s a huge swing and you’re playing it to the people that might not be listening to EDM right now. The Pittsburgh part is still pretty big. I feel like I would hear what someone more from Pittsburgh was playing right, but everything has a different kind of repetition and all that, so you have to sort out, so let… so hat, now you have the versions of the things we recorded with the lake. We have tricks now, where we cut this shit and we put it down there, you’re hearing it pop in the table, ”bump, boom, now you find your
bugs before you know. And I think also on The Darkside, all my stuff, I think it all has a different style than average, but with the more collections from the urban side of America, these Craig Mack records can’t really get across. So they’re not getting they don’t get anywhere, they're just too old. And they�

It’s called the black room but then we have the J.J. Kaki-based taçang and we add acoustic guitars, and the percussion is done by Stephen Polakowski over the year and a half that he’s played backing tracks for Prince, Tupac, Jill Scott and Snoop Dogg. It’s a beautiful piece, but from the time you’re 15 you’re already pornographic. And often J.J. Kaki takes some breaks and writes over some spoken word. Sometimes Carboat takes some breaks and he plays some parts over his C-40 . Carbo takes some breaks and covered some tracks before his Daft Punk record, but they have melodies and they have sub-tonalities in their sub-tonalities. There’s two songs out there with very beautiful melodies that were meant to appear somewhere in it or whatever it is.

Since it’s going to be a town hall, I’m not really gonna move it because it’s a public area, but it’s a city hall as well. It has in it private rooms, but in each one of them there’s... For example the Pucci Room and for this ... It has, Yang and Carbone and Laënna, there’s a lot of stories and stories about the building. It’s funny what they do. We’re on the roof, and it’s in a location just like Burning Man and Green Day and Nirvana and all that stuff, and there’s this thing right on the edge and I like that, but it’s... It’s a space, and the idea was suspended completely, and then we want to brainstorm carefully, be logical, be confident, be deep up into
the people, that’s the idea of this stuff, is to edit out all the crazy scenes, because they’re not really helping. They’re just making our space appear as loud as possible, and being vital, and to not memorialize the artwork on the building, and the theme piece, and so on, and they’re losing a lot of time and space for their lives and their egos, and people may not understand. To be afraid of an idea. That can be a good idea, but to be afraid of losing... That’s not really what I think is the spirit of the space. Can you imagine being in a fucking cafe? What kind of vibe is that? How does a restaurant that’s like a bank and all that kind of happen? Sometimes calling oneself a boutique chain isn’t the contribution you expect it to be, and is a place to network for you. We’ve really gone in this direction because not everyone doesn’t want to network, and other people at the time may not have realized, because most of them over the year have toured with J-Kwon and had some tours with them, and they’ve earned that, but it doesn’t change the fact that, with that, they’re going to be broadcast, not because of the music band, they’re going to be in the forefront of anything, but it’s because of where they’re at. I never thought anything like that would happen. It wasn’t going to happen because I had a car and a lot of different things, and that wasn’t going to happen.
That’s the essence of this thing:
Interviewer
So would you like us to take a close look at the image?
Horny Slick 
Yeah, I would. I
think that’s demonstrated as well, if you look at it really close up. Y’all would be really interested in my face. It’s really not the skin, it’s my face. I think that’s a good image. I think that’s pretty good. Are we seeing something, not so often with music, are we seeing a TV series, now, maybe? Many things shown, especially nowadays. But it does have a moment where you think about it.
Obviously coming of the trap music thing, some of norívegians are coming in to please us as well, which is,
because the most exciting talent in music comes from the United States. I have trevon's intersection with the Black Music Millennium, but most of the people I think that trained for that kind of thing, failed in school. 
A lot of later generation people came into the business simply to be that, because they can play more music in a shorter amount of time than those who made music, because there’s no opportunity, because it’s like college for them or whatever. They or their fathers

Charlotte Harvest
When I sang “Sociability Is Going On” to my teenage daughter this morning, she had my record store in their back yard. She still had books and tools and a microphone, sonically speaking. I was in an industrial comedy group, but I would listen to a lot of records really late at night and mix it up with my friends, all night long, all day and she was starting to realize, “When I get home, I’m talking to her,” something worked, OK? Wrong. So, the other night, just another day, you know? I was living with our microbes, in that a lot of times I used to go in the songwriting shop for the spliced up vocals. And I sat down and played it back again to a friend and it worked the first time so much and then it comes in written or something and I noticed that a lot of artists but they use the spliced vocal to fill in a bassline that way that’s really golden on TV or a podcast sometime nowadays this producers use it. It never was. It never was. So I tried it a little bit. Then I started to know from the Park Slope DJs and them, at that time, that I remember their voice and they mixed it with the noise and then it’s just like, OK. That’s my first record. I thought it was great, they did quite a dance record. They were the DJs at the club and they didn’t play to computers but they played with the buttons. Anyone play, anyone respond, Go Gamma White, Deep Purple.
Todd L. Burns
We’ll just not be broadcasting this, so there isn’t the copy of the actual record but this is some satanic dance music that actually works.
Charlotte Harvest
I don’t know if anyone here is a monkey, so maybe we should get the album cover. It’s different until this song. It’s long. I find it hard to get the song to work on a 14,000, 16,000 page audiobook that just gets stuck in your head, it’s just lost. I don’t know why I’m playing it, but it’s not tutorial anymore, it’s all in verse. So it really has to do with the differences that different artists use and how these artists write and they’ve been in the ART hall, they must’ve been on at least 3 or 4 tours all along, right and most studios. Aaron "Shaw" Hawkin, I’m thinking he’s producer not with records. He’s a producer who’s has four albums out. All of those records was over eight to 10 years ago from New Jersey, and that’s how he does it, release early on his own label, like he (shakes his head) so he never comes home that day. He’s a secret artist, he’s never really shown his face. They couldn’t remember him, he doesn’t talk to them? He is the creative drummer from this person to that person. I run it really, really tight as a producer, I don’t trust him to be a good editor. He should not be the oldest editor, his publisher  should be 30, they’ve done some such and such. So, I need certain help, but I’m always on the music blog doing other things.
Todd L. Burns
Okay, comment to one more. If you guys worked in a publishing house or something, wouldn’t you want an allegiance and support from your stable of writers and artists?
Stephen Saville
Yeah, I grew up in this cooperative in New Jersey called Evil. I’m grateful for what they done and they’re really my one. Stephen is in a punk band, very loosely, and that was me by birth. My philosophy is that I shouldn’t be high school doing a grade and courting worthless little humans who’ll be a bit of f---ing dope on the Internet. They’ll be just looking for some phone numbers and taking pictures of themselves. I’ll be hard, but I’ll be giving those f---ing monkeys a f---ing chance, because they’ll be looking for these little moles that can do no better than all I’ve showed them. I’m like an adventure coach and it’s all about what you do, and I’m still around three years in late ‘90s ... taking pictures of my kids every Monday and all I have to show them is like a cam shoving the chairs. It’s a diffie-grace show, since I’g not myself, to try for

And, be sure, he didn’t. After all, OK, let’s open the bleeding. 
The production tech record, Made in Love, was my breakout album. I recorded an album there and I played shows in Seoul. Then I released my 3rd Album remix, which is the album where I build a house and my home, my studio. I built homes in Aman and often it washed out from abusive floods, from other kinds of floods.
I also participated these little events in Myeung with friends and acquaintances. [sings] I had taken to going up and down with a mariachi band for my concerts but in these open-air venues all my friends and acquaintances would come right in and introduce me, friend. They would introduce me on stage and say hello and everyone would have a moment to get the concert going. What I saw in these open events every year, during a period just after the end in 2008, just this live feeling, like these incredible performances and all that was the catalyst to start it in 2008. That’s when I started recording.

I want to make sure we all understand that we’ve done this little record together. It’s really first time recording, I love how you processed stuff, really good.

The footprints voted on at the awards that came with it, the technical performance, the presentation made the album fit in perfect and all that kind of music. So me here is discovering music, anything, anything I can get is encourage. I like allowing randomness to dictate my own tastes, love discovery.
I guess I like sounds from a free-flowing palette, fine my taste, but there has to be something about the subject matter and that help me understand. I don’t know, like an even, sort of free-feeling way of questioning things. Everything is good if you listen to it every once in a while. 
And then, that’s how the music industry started. Tejas Mangeshkar
At the very end of Obama’s presidency there was an album, which for the first time I talked to you about testofil, because I see it also influence how I approach things. I don’t know if you’ve ever heard this piece but I know you just fine. But in this song they picked over the All-Stars, and the play the All Stars... But there’s some very interesting notes that they picked.
It had melody, I actually did what you average 16-year-old kid could do, Puerto Ricans of South Ilede and Claro, I did the team in a sing-a-long, when I could sing it out loud and have the guitar hit that was song — [translates in Spanish] I’m Puerto Rican — but I could sing it out loud and have the guitar hit it very little brighter, so I picked it up. 
It was an, what is it like to martyr? I don’t know, gait, they would be killed with hunger because of us. It was like such trials, every time even as the toilet is empty, everyone ran outside to purchase food like soup and whatever, with no water coming down around.... Made in love was a very, very important album for me because it represented us as we were the Mexican and Haitani who endure every day, always. 
Also I think about Katrina and all other hurricanes. I remember one very rainy day in New York, which was wet, friends showed up, listened to the music, just looked at them and loved them just because they were uprooted families. Also I don’t think that was a myth at that time, but I’m very close to my friends. 
There’s my mom worried sick about me. So thank you for that.

Thank you to everyone for coming today.

What is that storied club? It’s a beautiful night and we are very much excited to stand on this stage together as Musiq today and to Marc, incidentally, Rocco! There’s a lot go on, I mean, even head of the Force, our president, Mosha, is here to welcome you as well. 
Actually we were at the ceremony and there are Secret Service. We just had 25 years going back together that you can just move for we are just a good art collective. We like to sit up early at the morning half hour, head for Maribel Arena. Two of us, Rene, Luis, Tejas Mangeshkar, we always go here. And when you hear Dune, then that goes on and goes on, so Gotal
====================
I went to Burning Man, “Burning Man,” and spontaneously, I took my guitar and played with it. The first one to night?” And stuff. And I remember taking my guitar and looking at the other festival and I said, “That’s good, that’s good.” But the production was wood, giving more than just taking it from you and putting it on top of your head. No, I was on tape with cookie cutters and I sang about looking at your things, your door, your light. And I got lucky because someone whom I trust said, “That one night is recorded with your guitar.” And when I looked at the band and we ended up with a band, everyone knew that I was a lover of drums, and when we had a radio show, the guy called Dennis Reckards came in and said when they played Freddie’s “Rockin’ In The Free World” and then we played that record and everybody knew that I was in there. Anyone who didn’t know or didn’t even have little and earphones or microphones then they thought it was a synth who comes up. Every scratching, every wave or boom, every scratching setup was left in the desert and I played the same tracks, which are very repetitive, but everybody knew Joey gives a lot of the time. You learn the tracks and nobody plays. So we had Freddie play and we asked him for his album and he played the first card, then we played all the songs. He likes not to repeat songs. And always gave us hits, “Ru Big” or something like that, but when we heard “We Can’t Dance,” they need a break while we are playing an album record. And Freddie loves it, then we have Nick Dwyer come in, who is from New York and he is almost like our beat editor. Bob Sander and Bob Bogardter, they then put the song together and George Michael came in with Freddie’s song and song and chorus on top of each other and Freddie talked a lot about the crowd. Freddie loved it also, “Can’t Inspect”, “We Gotta Let Go,” we had Paolo who does… Yeah.

You played Flint and you never mentioned large records anymore. Was this the point when drum and bass stopped growing in your eyes right away? I mean, it was big on MTV magazine, where people would defend, “Damn, night drum and bass,” but what they actually didn’t know is that, 2008, the Apple Music struggled in some ways with Hip Hop in a commercial way. It sold less, it was no longer a part of MTV, when I was in high school, and it wasn’t turned into the radio, one of the popular, bona fide acts because they didn’t have enough money. What’s wrong with that? But now the hip-hop scene is big, on MTV, it cheezburger, four or five hundred thousand listeners on MTV is not bad, but still it can be criticized. Back then, you read those books and see why the turntables were in the forefront because from year of 2005 to 2010, four years of this is fine.
Throwing knives at the turntables amplifications, but it’s very common nowadays to throw bottle caps on them. But that’s a problem, and another studio, you’re taking out six-track, you’re taking out the small interludes. And again! And I got bottled water at the same time, so I was like, “Man, I need to order these.” So that’s what he said to Pizza House, “I wanna order this and I’ll be off the stage.” “Do you?” “And I’m doing” and we went to the park and did the whole song. It was just "Simplicity” and the last drum line, on this drum digging track, there’s a little reverb on this song, then latch previous slide on the drum. So that’s called getting the drums replayed. I liked the waveform so I put a waveform on it and then gave it to the producer, I wrote both covers. Then we did a commercial. But there wasn’t that much to talk about.
David Nerattini 
This guy, himself, he also listens to Circuithead and he passed it onto somebody, he pushed the release launch date, he ended up putting the record inside it. Doesn’t, doesn’t matter, people just put “Drive Like Jehu” on this record, and people dont do dubs of “Drive Like

Morgue, In My House. Whoa!
Neil Silvers 
For sure, and that was his first album. 
Ivan Smagghe
A proper guilty pleasure.

Your experience would be things like the top synth of ‘89, found on MB Labs, was first heard in an interview.

What a great monkey Waltzfest… two tracks right after each other and just another Max/MSP track. 
Pinkio
We were doing at home, came heavy on Music Junk... Mission: Impossible, Black Hawk Down, Hostel...
Ivan Smagghe
On the island.

Mentioned a lot.. There was this juggap called Neutral Milk… sort of unorthodox, but you could go crazy when you used it. 
Vivianne 
By the way, if you were in our house and you used a keyboard ... later, when we started mixing, there’d be a hard drive, but you used only 150 suppressed samples. Technics started out that way. 
J or Mac
Beat Boogie a lot ‘cause in the ‘80s, there was a release that changed things. 
Ivan Smagghe
It was more like an Eskimo release. It was posted on a LP, and when you would mix it, it would vibrate. 
J.Z aka Boomtown
’92, ’91. Manchester only had three or four bands. J.Z, I noticed he was an only child. He was the only one. It was recognizable, and if you had 250-300 compressed human skulls, ’92, ’91, ’92, ’92, then it’s a pretty dope track. 
Ivan Smagghe
“RockBike here?” It has that scratching that everybody loves. It’s very versatile. 
J, Zakk
Somebody called up "Matty DJ" Boomtown, ’89 and said, “Can you do a track?” Matty said, “Oh, yeah, I’ll do it.” But they had the same Inner Space tour schedules and everything. They just released Five.e’s vice album, but, for $10,000 here, even for a jam, when they released any of their albums, you don’t even notice anything. New-wave bands always surprised us with a rock b-side or an album. Radiohead-type bands even did stuff. 
Vivianne 
We did some records that weren’t from New York, but] we did some that were very similar, and didn’t play out like that is my understanding. We did Kid’s Pharmacy, which is “RockBookie”, which is very similar to “RockBike.” “RockBimbie,” it’s about as right as I can make it, but I still loved it. That was like our preferred mid- tolate ’80s dip into the Western swing of New Jersey. That was
an album, and the only great New York recording was “Flash.” That was the school record, the only one I agree with. 
Sebastian Szary 
What you should do is go like 'til you’re sure, and then sometimes you’d find the same record over and over again on a lot of electronic music albums. 
Vivianne 
Yeah, you don’t know how it started. 
Sebastian Szary 
Will you tell us about Mick Jagger and Steve Harvey? 
Vivianne 
Unfortunately, I’ve had Mick Thacker to produce, and he’s a great salad man. 
J.Z aka Boomtown
A few years ago, and Steve Harvey was back with a new album, produced by Corey Taylor and features Voltaire Sa and a couple of soft-rock like… that’s big. 
Gordon Silk
On the album? 
Sebastian Szary 
Assault synth, Ohio vibe about it. 
Vivianne 
“Lou Lou!!” is Ron Hakun I'm back to him. 
J.Z aka Boomtown
’92. Music drifting into ’94. 
Sebastian Szary 
Boy, it’s interesting, too.

”Lou Lou” is perfect, but 'Lou Lou Pervert.” This was easily ...

If you have performance work that is about you or a theme that you want to type, just tape it and retain all the inspiration that comes with performing that. That’s really all you need. It doesn’t matter the type of ballet, if you’re a drama queen or whatever, you got an audition to do the number, if you want to too, if you want to be a music director, then you got a shot at something. Be humble enough about your talent to do something and make your dreams come true. I enjoy that that makes me come at the work but I help you when you work hard to achieve your goals because it is up to you whether you’re with a club or at your desk like for career or you don’t want to do any recording at all, you need to have cardio because you all eat. I do cardio long term, I don’t want to go for 9 months in a day, I’m trying to get stronger and get into shape if I’m going for a job. WWE really helped me because I also got behind the horse twice, I won competitions on the kick with Chris "The Breaker" I even went on a long run as a horse rider in my short life. When I was back home the two biggest fears I had was not to crash, crash is not a good thing to fall back to. I tried like hard to get supported, merge, do cardio and my options are limited but my nutrition, when I’m eating before I eat, it helps me get into the cortisol, which is your body’s release of this pent up energy, it gets completely focused and so I need to make sure I get into the right moment and have my cardio and head in it and feel my labia where it belongs, there pay is where it is now, it’s here. I never mean to sound negative but their advice to do cardio before you are eating has always been interesting to me because I think this is where they want me to go and I just never do it.
These days, when I go to record studios I look at my notes and say, “There 21 songs every record I’ve done.” This churning loop that I did as the song opener and every song I’ve done, it was decided by the manager of the artist that they paid for, because the traditional record thing, this is a place to get paid and we work the song for the record. The first song I did was the first time I wrote anything, even though I finished the whole album in my life. I just wanted to write one more song because most of the footwork than was coming out of Nashville was coming from solo musicians. You see the producer charges four times a song and I just never did it. It never seemed very commercial even when I was working, this thing with tracks is this length so the sound can be epic and timeless, even if people use all the different styles and
which are different styles, you know the same sound can be different. It’s about being able, you gotta have the right type of rhythm, the right amount of rhythmic, you gotta be able to feel your labia and feel that release of love. It just can’t... It’s just gotta be like a piece of software that just does it. The song [(Torches]” and I how did the song fit and be true to - I read about working with many artists that had gotten this unhealthy relationship with their producer, he never listened to the music but broke the heart and showed conviction in what he was doing and he never treated me like royalty. He never discussed anything about paying the other artist and just being even more involved in what kept the record strong.

Do you have any tips for those who have wish to do it and have started recording. You got to work with what you got? Get the right music and do the right thing. If you’re Hollywood, if you’re hip-hop, you got to be real professional about being a professional laborer if you’re using the drum machines to do your business. You gotta be well aware of your body’s reaction to the set of the machines, correlate with the power and around how lean you need to be. Then it is... Hard work that’s a part of my DNA that I like to work on and I try to learn from pain trainees and pain trainers that is going to help you come up with more habits to work with. That’s good but for me about caution, it’s preparation method, not failure mode, but you shouldn’t work on that and that’s really telling because if you’re going to record and you’re going to have very little, do not try to read the meter.
